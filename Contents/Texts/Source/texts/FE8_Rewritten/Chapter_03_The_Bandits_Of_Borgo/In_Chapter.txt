And here... we... go![A][N]
Hah![A] Not a soul saw me.[N]
These bandits are easy pickings.[A][N]
They're gonna regret messing with[N]
Neimi...[A][N]
I don't give a crap about Lark, but...[A][N]
You bastards made her cry.[A][N]
Let's see if I can't find that mirror...[A][N]
and snag some loot on the way.[A][X]

C-Colm...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
Woah, Neimi?![A][N]
What are you doing here?![A][N]
I told you to wait for me,[N]
didn't I?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I couldn't... it's too dangerous.[A][N]
C'mon, let's go home.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Neimi, we don't HAVE a home![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][CloseEyes]
Ah![A] Okay please, just...[N]
don't shout...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...Listen, just leave everything to me.[A][N]
I can take care of it in a flash, but I don't[N]
want you tagging along.[A][N]
You'll only hold me back.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
But... but...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Arrrgghhh...[N]
Oh, this is ridiculous.[A][N]
We'll talk later![A][N]
Just... don't leave my side, Neimi.[A][N]

[OpenMidLeft]
Ross?![A] What are you[N]
doing here?![A][N]
Does your father know[N]
you're here?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
.....[N][A]
I overheard your group were[N]
heading to the bandits' hideout.[A][N]
I followed behind.[A][N]

Please answer my second question.[A][N]
Does he know?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...[A]We're not safe in Ide.[A][N]
But he won't hear it.[A][N]
I left him a note,[N]
he knows where I am.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...given the circumstances, you[N]
can stay with us for now.[A][N]
But you aren't to leave our[N]
side.[A] Promise?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
You've got a deal.[A][N]
I'll show you what I can do![A][N]

about to cry...[A][X]
