Sir Seth, your reputation precedes you.[A][N]
It's not often I meet a knight[N]
of your caliber.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
General Duessel.[A] The honor is mine.[A][N]
You've been a legend in Renais since[N]
before I even held a sword.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Haha! Legend, you say?[A][N]
I'm not sure I've lived long enough[N]
to be granted that title.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Nonsense, you've served Grado with[N]
strength and wisdom for decades.[A][N]
Your name is spoken with respect[N]
across Magvel.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Mhm, in my experience, it is easy[N]
to earn respect in times of peace.[A][N]
But it is war that reveals the true[N]
nature of a knight... and a man.[A][N]
You've served Renais well, Seth.[N]
But tell me, how are you holding up?[A][N]
The burden of war weighs heavily,[N]
doesn't it?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...It does, yes. I've been entrusted[N]
with much, and I do my best to serve.[A][N]
But... there are times when doubt creeps in.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
That is only natural. We are only[N]
human, after all.[A][N]
Even a general must wrestle with doubt.[N][A]
True strength lies not in denying it[N]
but facing it head on.[A][N]
You will learn that in time.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Duessel]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Seth]
General Duessel, may I ask you[N]
something?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Of course, Seth. What troubles you?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I've pondered your words regarding[N]
facing my own doubts.[A][N]
But how do I ensure the[N]
same of my men?[A][N]
You've led your men through[N]
countless battles.[A][N]
How do you maintain their morale?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Ah, you're not the first to[N]
doubt your ability to lead, my boy.[A][N]
If I may say, you carry yourself in[N]
a very refined manner.[A][N]
You act as if you cannot afford[N]
the slightest mistake.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
It... is not my intention.[A][N]
Perhaps it is a lasting[N]
consequence of my squire days.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh...?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
In those days, Renais' army had been[N]
steadily declining in quality troops.[A][N]
An after-effect of the sudden retirement[N]
of one of our nation's champions.[A][N]
His fearlessness was a source of[N]
pride for his men, I'm told.[A][N]
Without his guidance, many felt they[N]
couldn't continue to serve.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
He must have been quite the warrior.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I came to enlist after hearing many[N]
a tale of his golden years.[A][N]
But I found the environment to be[N]
...less than inspiring.[A][N]
Few soldiers had the drive[N]
I was raised to believe in.[A][N]
I feared for the future of our kingdom,[N]
without a guide for the next generation.[A][N]
So I resolved to take up that mantle[N]
myself, and become the change I wanted.[A][N]
But I confess, that may have lead to me[N]
overcompensating in some areas.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Listen to me Seth, if I've learned[N]
anything, nobody expects perfection.[A][N]
Those we lead don't expect us to have all[N]
the answers.[A] Nobody can.[A][N]
What inspires men is to see their leaders[N]
stand firm in the face of adversity.[A][N]
They need to believe you will be[N]
their rock in such times.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Even if the situation seems hopeless?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Especially so![A][N]
Morale isn't held together by pretty[N]
speeches or promises.[A][N]
It's woven into the quiet strength you[N]
show when the odds are long.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I... that's quite, profound sir.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]
But when I see the faces of my men,[A][N]
the weight of their lives, it's[N]
hard to fathom.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
That is the burden we bear[N]
as generals, my boy.[A][N]
Every decision we make carries risk.[A][N]
Trust your experience to guide you[N]
in your decision making.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
I... will try.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Good.[A] But know this Seth; even the[N]
greatest of us make mistakes.[A][N]
What will define your legacy is[N]
what you choose to learn from them.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Thank you General, your words[N]
give me strength.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
You have a good head on your[N]
shoulders, Seth.[A][N]
I see in you the potential to become[N]
a far better leader than me.[A][X]

## A_Support_Seth_Duessel
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Seth]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Duessel]
Seth, I've been thinking. You remind[N]
me of myself, many years ago.[A][N]
I see the same dedication in your eyes,[A][N]
the weight of duty on your shoulders.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm honored by the comparison,[N]
General Duessel.[A][N]
But you've achieved so much...[N]
I'm still learning.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
[BoxHeight_3]
We are all always learning, Seth.[A][N]
Even now, I find new lessons in battle,[N]
in leadership.[A][N]
But the path you walk is a difficult one.[A][N]
Leading others is not just about strategy,[N]
it's about understanding those who[N]
follow you.[A][N]
Have you considered what comes after[N]
the war?[A][N]
[BoxHeight_2]
[OpenMidRight]
After the war?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes. Peace will come again.[N]
When it does, your role will change.[A][N]
It's easy to lead soldiers in battle,[N]
but guiding a nation during peace...[A][N]
that requires a different kind of strength.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I... have not considered it much.[A][N]
Right now my mind is too preoccupied[N]
with keeping her Highness safe.[A][N]
But I agree great care must be[N]
placed in our future decisions.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]
...Lest we repeat the ones that[N]
lead to this war...[A][N]
[OpenEyes]
[OpenMidLeft]
Exactly. We must be prepared to rebuild.[A][N]
To guide our people with the same strength[N]
we showed on the battlefield.[A][N]
You have the potential to shape Renais'[N]
future. Don't lose sight of that.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I will remember your words, General.[A][N]
I've learned much from you, and I'll[N]
do my best to apply it.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
[BoxHeight_3]
I'm glad to hear that. I've lived[N]
long enough to see many changes in[N]
the world.[A][N]
Now, I look forward to seeing the[N]
future you'll help create.[A][N]

## Epilogue_Seth_Duessel
Seth, for his part, continued to serve Renais[N]
with distinction, not only as a general but as[N]
a mentor to the kingdom's future leaders.[N]
Inspired by the advice of Duessel, Seth helped[N]
guide Renais into an era of peace, where the bonds[N]
of trust and hope became as strong as the armor of[N]
its knights. Though the two generals served[N]
different kingdoms, they remained close friends[N]
and often exchanged letters, sharing the lessons[N]
they continued to learn in peace as they had once[N]
done in war.[A][X]

## Epilogue_Duessel_Seth
After the war, Duessel returned to Grado,[N]
but his days as a general were at an end.[N]
He retired from military service, but not[N]
from leadership. His wisdom was sought[N]
throughout the land, and he served as a[N]
trusted advisor to Grado's new government.[N]
He often sought advice from Renais' General[N]
Seth, having forged an iron-clad friendship[N]
on the battlefield. Their bond served[N]
as a reminder to both nations what their[n]
future could look like.[A][X]
