Explore Seth's budding feelings for  Eirika.
His argument is that his station forbids such
a romantic entanglement and would conflict
with his duty to her.
But it would be interesting to have someone
remind him (maybe Garcia or Duessel?) that
now Renais has fallen, he is less the knight
of a princess by royal decree, and more the
bodyguard of a woman he has chosen to protect.
What feelings of conflict he has on the matter
no longer have basis in reality.

In the vanilla game, Grado and Renais were said
to have very strong bonds, almost assuredly
helped by the kind nature of Vigarde. Yet
almost immediately after the war is triggered,
we see the majority of Grado's soldiers possessed
of a bloodthirsty amount of violence. With only
small contingents opposing the war in any form.
This puts the lore of the story in conflict
with the gameplay.
To remedy this, it'd be worth exploring Grado's
citizens unease at their emperor's prolonged absence
from public life, and the economic and social consequences
of Lyon leaving the throne empty while he dabbled in
dark magic research (famine, extortion, rape etc). 
Perhaps this allowed the rise to power of fanatics who took 
advantage of the chaos and steered the citizens growing 
hatred of their nation's lack of leadership towards
foreign borders in a bid to deflect the blame from Lyon/Vigarde
and sycophantically appease the prince. Which they
could then use to cement themselves a position in
governance? Maybe Riev could take this role?

When Valter suggests that Orson's loyalty is not
purely driven by matyric desires, I suspect what he's getting
at is that Orson is basically begging to die ever since
he lost his wife. So when he says that the two of them have
a lot to talk about, he's probably going to inform him of
Riev/Lyon/Knoll's experiments with reviving the dead.

In the Intermission chapter in Serafew, I make reference to a poem
that's meant to highlight the dragons sacrifice to Magvel against
the demon king. Their contributions have been mostly scrubbed from
the history books and exist now only in vague poems by the faithful
as a last means of defense against being wiped from the history
books entirely.
"The crowned bore blades that stole the praise,
Yet fires unseen had carved the way.
In sky-bound arcs where truth took flight,
Their wings bled dusk to birth the light.
Forgotten flames in shadow's guise,
Breathe still within the faithful's cries."

Leading into that, maybe rework the history of the 5 heroes so that
they were actually cowardly oppurtunists who took advantage of
Morva's people during the fight with the demon king to usurp
the sacred stones, sacred relics and skill scrolls by extension.
Using them to found their own nations and subsequently bury the
truth of the battle so that they may be revered as heroes by
their descendants.

The relics, however, could not be used by the heroes
as a last preventative measure by Morva to prevent
another full scale war. The scrolls were developed
as part of each countries' research into replicating
the power the relics and stones possessed.

Terper has changed the stones being destroyed
to the stones being stolen.
My current idea for this loops back into the stones
being concentrated sources of manakete stone energy.
Perhaps the stones are too powerful to destroy?
Either that attempting to do so would be like
trying to punch diamond, or that if they were broken
the would go off like a nuke?
Vigarde/Lyon/Riev could both be concentrating the
stones in one location so that the undead can
travel further across Magvel, and researching to
extract their energy to strengthen their control
over the undead and move them more strategically?
