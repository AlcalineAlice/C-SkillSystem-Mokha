[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Eirika]
[OpenMidLeft]
Easy enough. You okay, Eirika?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes. I'm fine.[A][N]
But I am surprised Grado is[N]
already on to us.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...And then there's that thing that[N]
soldier shouted during the battle.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
About my bracelet, yes.[A][N]
We can assume that Orson did[N]
tell Grado about their purpose, then.[A][N]
General Valter did not take it as a[N]
mere trophy.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Yeah, looks like it.[N]
Sister... you heard them.[A][N]
They're specifically[N]
targeting you, now.[A][N]
Can I really not convince you[N]
to return to Frelia?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
No, you cannot.[A][N]
I know you only wish to[N]
keep me safe, Ephraim, but...[A][N]
Please try to see it[N]
from my perspective.[A][N]
If my bracelet was taken,[N]
and yours safe...[A][N]
Would you choose to stay[N]
in Castle Frelia?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
No, but... that is different.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
How?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm more experienced than you.[A][N]
And you don't know fighting, right?[N]
Well, I do.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
No, I don't like it.[N]
But that's completely irrelevant.[A][N]
We've already had this talk.[A][N]
I'm not about to do the same song and[N]
dance every time you want to doubt me.[A][N]
Besides, how can I expect my friends to[N]
fight for me if I won't do the same?[A][N]
Please, drop it and move on.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
Sister...[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_BanditPirate][BoxType_Thoughts]
Maybe if I stay quiet,[N]
they'll forget they captured me...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Now, as for you...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][BoxType_Thoughts]
Nutes.[A][X]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace_Eirika]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_BanditPirate]
So, uh.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
...[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I-I ain't gonna betray my boss.[A][N]
I don't know nuthin'.[A][N]
[MoveMidRight]
[OpenLeft][MoveRight]
Into the sea with you then.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight]
I-it was Caellach! Our boss![A][N]
He figured lettin' that survivor go[N]
would make problems...[A][N]
An' he was right![A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
General Caellach?[N]
...I see.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
You're about as ugly as one, but you[N]
don't look like a Grado soldier.[A][N]
What's your deal?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
No need to get personal![A][N]
We... some of us're[N]
buddies with the boss.[A][N]
From back when we was[N]
humble mercenaries and all.[A][N]
Then the boss landed this big gig[N]
and he called us up to help.[A][N]
Real nostalgic, really.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
I see. So...[A][N]
The majority of his forces are to push[N]
forward to Jehanna...[A][N]
[OpenRight]
...but he's left you louts to[N]
handle any flanks.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Uh... yeah, sounds about right.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
I see.[A][N]
Was this group the only one[N]
that General Caellach sent?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
I, uh... don't really know.[N]
We was sent first, so...[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Well, I guess that's about everything[N]
that we're going to get out of you.[A][N]
Ready to die?[A][N]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]
[OpenFarRight]
Haah! No, don't! Please, milord![A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Ephraim, don't![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
They're the ones who[N]
attacked us.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
You can't just kill someone who[N]
is unable to fight back![A][N]
Didn't you listen?[A][N]
General Caellach intentionally spared[N]
a soldier's life at the tower.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
He did, and now it's come back[N]
to bite him.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes. He has to have known that[N]
was a risk.[A][N]
but he spared the soldier anyway.[A][N]
Does that not speak to the strength[N]
of his character?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
The strength of his...[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Ephraim][MoveRight]
Are you addled?![A][N]
He spared one soldier, ONE![A][N]
Out of a tower defended by[N]
hundreds![A][N]
Am I supposed to revere him as a[N]
bastion of moral integrity?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I never said that.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Hey, uhh...[A][N]
[OpenRight]
If he was such a chivalrous fellow,[N]
he'd never have attacked that tower[A][N]
to begin with![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps, but he still spared[N]
an unarmed soldier.[A][N]
So that must mean he has[N]
his own code of conduct.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
A code is something men[N]
live by.[A][N]
Caellach falls far below[N]
that standard.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Don't dehumanize him Ephraim.[A][N]
That's not a road I can bare[N]
to see you walk down.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
!! I... can't believe I'm[N]
hearing this.[A][N]
Are you... actually sympathizing[N]
with the enemy?[A][N]
They're monsters Eirika![A][N]
They killed our father, they killed[N]
all those Frelian soldiers.[A][N]
They'd have killed you and me[N]
if we hadn't fought back![A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Umm... guys...?[A][N]
[OpenRight][MoveRight]
You be quiet if you know[N]
what's good for you![A][N]
[OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight]
Eeeek! Okay okay![A][N]
I'll keep my mouth shut.[A][N]
Silent Steve, that's what[N]
they call me![A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
I've seen monsters, Brother![A][N]
The creatures of myth we were[N]
told about as children.[A][N]
There's a difference between killing[N]
to defend your life...[A][N]
and killing just to slake your[N]
bloodlust![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
We're at war Eirika, don't[N]
you see that?![A][N]
If we spare them, they'll only[N]
regroup and come back stronger.[A][N]
And then, we might not be strong[N]
enough to beat them...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Brother...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I do what I do to keep the people[N]
I love safe.[A][N]
War isn't the sort of thing you[N]
can come out of with clean hands.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Those sound like General Duessel's[N]
words.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
And wise words they are.[A][N]
You may think me bloodthirsty, fine.[A][N]
But I take my instruction from men[N]
who have known war.[A][N]
The costs we face are too high to be[N]
choosy about our methods.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...[A][N]
[CloseEyes]
Urgh...[A][N]
You may have a just cause[N]
to kill this man, Ephraim.[A][N]
That, at least, I will grant you.[A][N]
I just... fear what choosing that[N]
road could mean for us...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Consider this my final[N]
request then.[A][N]
If it must be done, make it[N]
quick and make it swift.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Eirika]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Ephraim]
[OpenMidLeft]
...[A] Thank you brother, you did[N]
the right thing.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
You got what you wanted,[N]
Eirika.[A][N]
I only pray that it doesn't[N]
come back to bite us.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I have hope, Ephraim.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
How lovely that must be.[A][N]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
What's the matter?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm just considering[N]
Caellach's next move.[A][N]
He'll realize his hunch was right when[N]
he doesn't hear back from these men.[A][N]
If we can keep nipping at his heels,[N]
as we both move to Jehanna...[A][N]
We might succeed in making an invasion[N]
insurmountable.[A][N]
But if he petitions additional reinforcements[N]
from Grado, that goes out the window.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, I see...[A] but with things as[N]
they are, they'd have to cross Carcino.[A][N]
The mountaenous terrain should[N]
prove an obstacle for them.[A][N]
Any calvary or supply chains would be[N]
greatly impeded.[A][N]
They can't risk bringing just wyverns either.[N]
Frelia would decimate them.[A][N]
We have more to fear from a pincer[N]
attack from the south of Jehanna.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Indeed.[A][N]
Wait, how did you piece all[N]
of that together?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Seth has been gracious in teaching[N]
me something of military strategy lately.[A][N]
He knows he can't stop me from joining[N]
these battles.[A] Unlike you.[A][N]
So he said it was best that I learned[N]
to think like a commander.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
(Pity he didn't get to the part[N]
where dead men tell no tales.)[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Sorry, brother...[N]
did you say something?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Ah![A] Uh... hold that thought, Sister.[A][N]
A pegasus approaches.[A][X]

Princess Eirika![N]
Prince Ephraim![A][N]
I bring dire tidings[N]
from Prince Innes![A][N]
[OpenRight]
What's happened?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Carcino has betrayed us![A][N]
Their forces quickly put us to rout,[N]
and Prince Innes is still trapped![A][N]
The prince is still fighting, but...[N]
He has no means of escape, and--[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Thank you, we understand.[A][N]
Please stay and rest,[N]
we'll ride to Prince Innes immediately.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, Princess![A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenRight][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight]
What's going on?! Why would[N]
Carcino betray us?![A][N]
...Is this also[N]
Caellach's doing...?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I don't know...[N]
but it's not important now.[A][N]
We have to save Prince Innes![A][N]
Let's ask Vanessa to take[N]
us there immediately![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Okay.[A][N]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Vanessa]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Tana]
Vanessa! You heard, right?![A][N]
We've gotta go after my brother![N]
He's in danger![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Of course, Highness.[N]
But please, calm yourself.[A][N]
Have faith in your brother.[N]
He will overcome, no matter the odds.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I-I know, but still...![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Princess.[A] Lady Eirika wrote a report[N]
of what took place during her quest.[A][N]
She wrote that admist the confusion,[N]
fear and uncertainty,[A][N]
yours was the voice that calmed her.[N]
So please calm yourself, Princess.[A][N]
You have already spoken the words[N]
of reassurance.[A][N]
You need only remember them...[N]
And believe in your brother.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...Yeah, you're right![A][N]
Innes can handle himself![A][N]
Thank you Vanessa. You always[N]
know just what to say![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Thank you Princess. I try.[A][N]
Oh, and before I forget...[N]
this is a gift from you brother.[A][N]
He said he wanted to apologize for[N]
all those time he angered you.[A][N]
He regrets them, and promises to[N]
try his best to change.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Wow...[N]
But, did he really?[A][N]
That sounds really out[N]
of character for him...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I can assure you he spoke every[N]
word in his heart.[A][N]
Oh, but please do not bring it up[N]
with him.[A][N]
I fear that your brother[N]
would be a tad embarrassed.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Yeah, he would![N]
Thanks again, Vanessa![A][N]
Let's go![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
At your side, milady.[A][X]
