takes. Mages, monks, clerics[LF]
& shamans have high resistance.[.][X]

## MSG_0619

The continent of Magvel.[A][LF]
For some 800 years, a quiet peace reigned in [.][LF]
the absence of the terrible darkness.[.][A][LF]
The Sacred Stones have been passed from [LF]

Nations have been built around their power [.][LF]

These five countries house the power of [LF]

They are joined by the emerging mercantile [.][LF]

In these times of peace, tales of past[LF]

The Grado Empire, the largest of the [.][LF]
Sacred Stone nations,[.][A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
has invaded the kingdom of Renais under [LF]
orders from Emperor Vigarde.[A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
A longtime ally of Grado, Renais is caught[LF]
off guard, unable to mount any resistance.[A][LF]

Grado's forces move quickly, seizing one[LF]
territory after another.[A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
Compounding King Fado's worries, his son,[.][LF]
Prince Ephraim, has gone missing.[.][A][CR][LF]
[BreakTalk]
Grado's momentum carries its armies to the [.][LF]
gates of Castle Renais itself.[A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
Renais will fall...[.][LF]
It is inevitable.[.][A][LF]

Once held by Grado's troops, it has become[LF]
home to a host of [ToggleRed]dark creatures[ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
Battling these monstrosities is a good [.][LF]

Be aware: you cannot save your battle [LF]

Eirika should do [.][ToggleRed]7[.][ToggleRed] points,[LF]
and the enemy should do [ToggleRed]9[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
You see the [ToggleRed]x2[ToggleRed] next to[LF]
[ToggleRed]Mt[ToggleRed], right?[A][LF]
This indicates that you will[LF]
[ToggleRed]attack twice[ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
Eirika is faster than her[.][LF]
opponent, so she can [.][ToggleRed]strike[LF]
twice[.][ToggleRed] in one turn.[.][A][LF]
So, with [.][ToggleRed]2 attacks of 7[LF]
points each[.][ToggleRed], Eirika will[.][LF]
do [.][ToggleRed]14 points[.][ToggleRed] of damage.[.][A][LF]
Now press the [ToggleRed]A Button[ToggleRed] to[.][LF]
[ToggleRed]attack[ToggleRed] the enemy.[.][A][X]

Do you see [.][ToggleRed]Hit[.][ToggleRed] displayed[LF]
below [ToggleRed]HP[ToggleRed] and [.][ToggleRed]Mt[ToggleRed]?[.][A][LF]
[ToggleRed]Hit[.][ToggleRed] is the likelihood that[.][LF]
you will land your blow.[A][LF]
Eirika's [.][ToggleRed]Hit[.][ToggleRed] is 94, so she[LF]
has a 94 percent chance[.][LF]
of hitting the enemy.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleRed]Crit[ToggleRed], short for Critical, also[LF]
appears in this window.[.][A][LF]
This is the chance an attack[LF]
will be a lethal strike.[A][LF]
Eirika's [.][ToggleRed]Crit[ToggleRed] is 14, so she[LF]
has a 14 percent chance of[LF]
landing a killing blow.[.][A][LF]
Critical attacks do [ToggleRed]3 times[.][ToggleRed][LF]
the damage of a normal[LF]
attack.[.][A][LF]

The relationship between [.][ToggleRed]swords[ToggleRed], [ToggleRed]lances[ToggleRed],[.][LF]

[ToggleRed]Lances[ToggleRed] are strong against [ToggleRed]swords[ToggleRed].[.][LF]
[ToggleRed]Swords[ToggleRed] are strong against [ToggleRed]axes[ToggleRed].[.][LF]
[ToggleRed]Axes[ToggleRed] are strong against [ToggleRed]lances[ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
In that last battle, the enemy commander,[.][LF]
Breguet, wielded a [.][ToggleRed]lance[.][ToggleRed], while the[.][LF]
Frelian soldier used a [.][ToggleRed]sword[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
[ToggleRed]Lances[ToggleRed] are strong against [ToggleRed]swords[ToggleRed],[.][LF]
so Breguet had an advantage.[A][LF]
The [ToggleRed]weapon triangle[.][ToggleRed] can be very[LF]
important in determining the outcome of[.][LF]
a battle. For the time being, just[A][LF]
remember that [ToggleRed]lances[ToggleRed] are strong[.][LF]

beginning of your turn.[.][A][LF]
Currently, the enemy commander, Breguet,[LF]
is standing on a [.][ToggleRed]gate[ToggleRed]. Even if he takes[LF]
damage, he'll soon [.][ToggleRed]recover some of the[.][ToggleRed][LF]
[ToggleRed]HP[ToggleRed] he lost.[.][A][X]

## MSG_0943
Starting with this chapter, you will[LF]
control not only Eirika, but also Seth,[.][LF]
general of the Knights of Renais.[.][A][LF]
You select and move him in the same way[.][LF]
you do Eirika: by placing the cursor[LF]
on him and pressing the A Button.[.][A][LF]
When all of your units have finished[LF]
moving, your enemy's turn will begin[LF]

pointing up[.][ToggleRed]. This is because[.][LF]
Seth has a [.][ToggleRed]sword[.][ToggleRed], while[.][LF]
the soldier has an [.][ToggleRed]axe[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
The [ToggleRed]weapon triangle[.][ToggleRed] states[.][LF]

against [ToggleRed]axes[ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
Seth is at an advantage.[A][X]

Ross is a [ToggleRed]journeyman[ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
[ToggleRed]Journeymen[ToggleRed] are inexperienced[LF]
fighters with low combat skills.[A][LF]
When they reach [ToggleRed]level 10[ToggleRed], they[A][LF]
can [ToggleRed]change classes[ToggleRed] to become more[.][LF]
powerful [.][ToggleRed]fighters[ToggleRed] or [ToggleRed]pirates[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
You should avoid sending [.][ToggleRed]journeymen[ToggleRed][LF]
to face strong enemies.[.][A][CR][LF]
Ross's father is Garcia, a [.][ToggleRed]fighter[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
[ToggleRed]Fighters[ToggleRed] who reach level 10 or higher[.][LF]

one of your [ToggleRed]allies[ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
The green unit on the other side of the[.][LF]
mountains is Garcia. He is still [.][ToggleRed]neutral[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
If you get the right person to talk to[LF]
him, he may become an [ToggleRed]ally[ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
Move into spaces adjoining green units[LF]
and select [.][ToggleRed]Talk[ToggleRed].[.][A][CR][LF]
Ross is Garcia's son. Move Ross into a[LF]

There is an [ToggleRed]armory[ToggleRed] due south of here.[.][A][LF]
You could probably take the [ToggleRed]red gem[.][ToggleRed] you[LF]
got at the village and sell it there.[.][A][X]

## MSG_0989
It's a good idea to buy iron swords and[.][LF]
other everyday weapons at [ToggleRed]armories[ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
However, your funds are not endless.[A][LF]
There are [ToggleRed]armories[ToggleRed] in other towns, too,[.][LF]

[ToggleRed]Walls[.][ToggleRed] with cracks in them can be[.][LF]
attacked and destroyed.[.][A][LF]
Once a wall is destroyed, you can pass[LF]
through the opening you've created.[.][A][LF]
When your way seems blocked, be sure[LF]
to check all the [.][ToggleRed]walls[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][X]

## MSG_099C
The bandits' [.][ToggleRed]hand axes[.][ToggleRed] can be used[LF]
in both [ToggleRed]direct[ToggleRed] and [.][ToggleRed]indirect combat[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
They can be wielded like normal axes[LF]
in direct, hand-to-hand combat[A][LF]
or thrown to strike enemies who are[.][LF]
a space away or at an angle to you.[.][A][LF]
Like bows, they can also hit enemies[LF]
on the [.][ToggleRed]other sides of walls[ToggleRed].[.][A][X]

## MSG_099D
The [ToggleRed]thief[.][ToggleRed] Colm has appeared.[.][A][LF]
Thieves can [ToggleRed]steal[.][ToggleRed] items from[.][LF]
other units.[A][LF]
Also, they can [.][ToggleRed]open the locks[ToggleRed] of[.][LF]
[ToggleRed]doors[.][ToggleRed] and [.][ToggleRed]chests[ToggleRed]. Thieves[.][LF]
are handy allies to have around.[A][X]

## MSG_099E
Place the cursor on a unit and press[LF]
the [ToggleRed]R Button[ToggleRed] to display that[LF]
unit's [.][ToggleRed]status[ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
For example, if you select a bandit[.][LF]
and press the [ToggleRed]R Button[ToggleRed], you'll[LF]
see that he's carrying a hand axe.[A][CR][LF]
If you press the [.][ToggleRed]R Button[ToggleRed] again,[.][LF]
you'll see [.][ToggleRed]help information[ToggleRed] for each[.][LF]
item on-screen.[.][A][LF]
You can use the [ToggleRed]R Button[ToggleRed] to see[.][LF]
the properties of weapons and items.[A][LF]
If there's something you don't [.][LF]
understand about [.][ToggleRed]unit information[ToggleRed], [LF]
press the [ToggleRed]R Button[ToggleRed].[.][A][X]

## MSG_099F
Bows are [.][ToggleRed]ranged weapons[ToggleRed].[.][LF]

who are a space away.[.][A][LF]
Additionally, they can be used[LF]
to attack over walls.[.][A][X]

## MSG_09A0
Colm and Neimi are childhood friends.[.][LF]
Try moving Neimi next to Colm and[.][LF]
have her [.][ToggleRed]talk[ToggleRed] to him. He[.][LF]
may decide to join you.[.][A][X]

## MSG_09A1
Colm and Neimi have an [.][ToggleRed]invisible[.][LF]
bond[ToggleRed] that ties them together.[.][A][LF]
Units that have such a bond can[.][LF]
develop a [ToggleRed]support relationship[ToggleRed].[.][A][CR][LF]
Units become closer and their bond[LF]
stronger the longer they are[LF]
[ToggleRed]adjacent to one another[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
Eventually, they will be able to[LF]
share a [ToggleRed]support conversation[ToggleRed].[.][A][CR][LF]
Units that share a support relationship[.][LF]
fight with [.][ToggleRed]improved abilities[ToggleRed][LF]
when they are near each other.[A][CR][LF]
There are three levels of support[.][LF]
units can share: [.][ToggleRed]C, B, and A[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
Levels are gained by staying[LF]
side-by-side as much as possible.[.][A][CR][LF]
Colm and Neimi are not the only units[.][LF]
that can have support relationships.[LF]
Eirika and Seth, among others, can [.][LF]
grow close to other units as well.[A][CR][LF]
Watch how characters interact with each[.][LF]
other to guess at who might share[.][LF]
a support relationship with whom.[.][A][CR][LF]
If you have two units you think may[.][LF]
have such a bond, [ToggleRed]place them next[.][LF]
to one another again and again[ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
Who knows: they may eventually share[LF]
a [ToggleRed]support conversation[ToggleRed].[.][A][CR][LF]
However, bear in mind that each unit[LF]
can have only [ToggleRed]5[.][ToggleRed] support relationships.[.][A][X]

## MSG_09A2
Enemy units may sometimes drop items[LF]
when they are defeated.[.][A][LF]
In the same way you searched for hand[.][LF]
axes earlier, try looking at enemy items[LF]
with the [.][ToggleRed]R Button[ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
[ToggleRed]Green items[.][ToggleRed] are items that will be [LF]
dropped. Check enemy items beforehand [LF]
to gain the advantage in combat.[A][X]

There are three different schools of[LF]
[ToggleRed]magic[.][ToggleRed], each of which is governed[.][LF]
by the [.][ToggleRed]trinity of magic[ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
[ToggleRed]Light[.][ToggleRed] is strong against [.][ToggleRed]Dark[ToggleRed].[.][LF]
[ToggleRed]Dark[ToggleRed] is strong against [.][ToggleRed]Anima[.][ToggleRed].[.][LF]
[ToggleRed]Anima[.][ToggleRed] is strong against [.][ToggleRed]Light[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
For now, just remember that [ToggleRed]Light[.][LF]
is strong against Dark[ToggleRed].[.][A][X]

## MSG_09B7
The [ToggleRed]magic[.][ToggleRed] that Artur and Lute[LF]
wield cannot be stopped by[LF]
physical [.][ToggleRed]defense[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
However, magic [.][ToggleRed]resistance[ToggleRed] can affect[.][LF]
the damage it does.[.][A][LF]
So, it's possible to do high damage to[LF]
units like [.][ToggleRed]knights[.][ToggleRed], who possess[.][LF]
strong [.][ToggleRed]defenses[ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
On the other hand, it's difficult to harm[.][LF]
units with high [ToggleRed]resistance[ToggleRed], like[LF]
pegasus knights.[A][LF]
Magic can also be used to attack[LF]
directly or indirectly, like a hand axe.[A][LF]
It can be wielded like a sword to strike[LF]
adjacent foes or like a bow to hit[LF]
enemies at a distance.[A][X]

## MSG_09B8
Starting on this map, you'll be able[LF]
to use the [.][ToggleRed]preparations screen[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
You can [ToggleRed]choose which units[ToggleRed] to send into[.][LF]
battle and [.][ToggleRed]manage items[ToggleRed] to secure[LF]
the best chance of victory.[.][A][X]

## MSG_09B9
Forests and other map areas may[.][LF]
offer [ToggleRed]terrain bonuses[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
Units in forests are harder to hit[LF]
and take less damage when struck.[.][A][LF]
Simply put, staying under trees makes[.][LF]
it more difficult for enemies to hit [.][LF]
and harm you.[.][A][LF]
Areas that have [ToggleRed]terrain bonuses[.][ToggleRed] are[LF]
[ToggleRed]forests[.][ToggleRed], [ToggleRed]mountains[.][ToggleRed], [ToggleRed]fortresses[ToggleRed], and[.][LF]
[ToggleRed]gates[.][ToggleRed], to name a few.[A][LF]
Use terrain to your advantage during[LF]

Sometimes, you can talk to an enemy and[.][LF]
convince him to join you.[.][A][LF]
For example, right now, [ToggleRed]Joshua[ToggleRed] might[LF]
be inclined to talk with [.][ToggleRed]Natasha[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][CR][LF]
However, [.][ToggleRed]Joshua[ToggleRed] is a [ToggleRed]red unit[ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
Unlike green units you've seen before,[LF]
he will [ToggleRed]attack[ToggleRed] until he's spoken to.[A][LF]
Moreover, [ToggleRed]Joshua[ToggleRed] is a [ToggleRed]myrmidon[ToggleRed], who[.][LF]
specializes in [.][ToggleRed]critical hits[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
If you are struck by a [.][ToggleRed]critical hit[ToggleRed], you[.][LF]
will suffer 3 times the normal damage.[A][LF]
It's a good idea to check [ToggleRed]Crit[ToggleRed][LF]
on the combat information window.[.][A][X]

## MSG_09D2
You got an armorslayer.[.][A][LF]
This weapon is similar to rapiers in[LF]
that you can severely injure knights[LF]
and generals with a single blow.[A][LF]
In such cases, the weapon icon on the[.][LF]
combat information window will flash.[.][A][X]

## MSG_09D3
There's an [.][ToggleRed]armory[ToggleRed] and a[LF]
[ToggleRed]shop[ToggleRed] in this city.[A][X]

## MSG_09D4
[ToggleRed]Armories[ToggleRed] sell iron swords, steel[LF]
lances, and other weapons.[A][LF]
[ToggleRed]Shops[.][ToggleRed] carry spells, vulneraries,[.][LF]
and a myriad of other items.[A][LF]
If you're running short on anything,[LF]
make sure you stock up here.[A][X]

## MSG_09D5
There's an [.][ToggleRed]arena[.][ToggleRed] here.[A][X]

## MSG_09D6
Arenas play host to [ToggleRed]one-on-one[LF]
combat matches[ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
If you win a match, you'll earn [ToggleRed]twice[.][LF]
the amount of the entry fee[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
If you lose, however, that unit [ToggleRed]will not[LF]
be able to fight in any future battles[ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
If your HP drops near zero in a fight,[LF]
[ToggleRed]press the B Button quickly[ToggleRed] to concede.[A][LF]
You'll lose your entry fee, but you'll[LF]
save your unit to fight again.[A][X]

[OpenMidRight]Eirika, try taking a deeper step[LF]
forward when you lunge.[.][A][LF]
Otherwise, you might find it hard to[LF]
dodge the counterthrust of a foe.[.][A][LF]
That's why you always want to end[.][LF]

All of this fighting[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]It is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I just pray that this fighting[LF]
will end as swiftly as possible.[A][LF]
No one desires this war.[A][LF]
So why must it continue?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Indeed.[.][A][LF]
And yet there is fighting in[LF]
every generation.[.][A][LF]
In ancient times, our ancestors[.][LF]
fought all manner of evil beast.[A][LF]
But once the beasts were subdued,[.][LF]
man then fought against fellow man[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
So we learned from Lyon.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I know[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
But if men understand the futility[LF]
of fighting, why do they do it?[.][A][LF]
We could gain so much more by[.][LF]
cooperation than by conquest.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]You may be right[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]But I think[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
I understand why.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why, Brother[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]I pray for peace to return to our[.][LF]
fair Renais.[A][LF]
I know that war brings only sorrow.[.][A][LF]
And yet, somewhere in my heart[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
There is a lust for battle that[.][LF]
cannot be stilled.[A][LF]
It screams within me when[.][LF]
I clutch this spear[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Brother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Perhaps it is because I am a man.[.][A][LF]
Perhaps it is because I was raised[LF]
to fight.[.][A][CR][LF]
I enjoy the practice of my art. I find[LF]
pleasure in the battle victorious.[A][LF]
And the stronger I become[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
The more strongly the call to arms[LF]
sounds within my ears.[A][LF]
I want to see how great is the skill[LF]
that I have acquired.[.][A][LF]
It may be crass and low, but I cannot[.][LF]
deny it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Brother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]You would disdain me for this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I could never[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
But, Brother, listen.[.][LF]
No matter why you fight[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Please ensure that this fighting brings[.][LF]
good to our people and to our kingdom.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[LF]
I am not so far gone as that.[.][A][LF]
And I could not bear to see[.][LF]
you cry for our people.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Besides, I would fear the judgment[LF]
of your mighty sword![.][A][ToggleSmile]

an end to this fighting soon.[.][A][LF]
We may yet defeat the evil in this land[.][LF]

[OpenMidRight]Please forgive my rudeness[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Princess, I am merely your subject.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]But I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
it's just that your wound[.][LF]

Perhaps it will afflict me to the end[.][LF]

But it would be a mistake to assume[.][LF]
you owe me a debt for this wound.[.][A][LF]
This thought should not rest beneath[LF]
the crown you soon must wear.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]But still, you suffered for me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Lady Eirika.[A][LF]
You are a noble of Renais.[A][LF]
The nobility should not favor[.][LF]
one subject over another.[.][A][LF]
How can they maintain their fealty[LF]
if you treat one so differently?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]You may have to forego such attachments[.][LF]
just to defend your country.[A][LF]
There will be times when victory[LF]

Perhaps[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I did feel something[LF]
more for you then.[A][LF]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]it was improper for a[.][LF]
queen of Renais.[A][LF]
And with my father dead, I suppose[LF]
that is my station.[.][A][LF]
I am a queen, and you are a knight[LF]

What a funny thing that we should meet[LF]
here! It is providence, I tell you![.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]L'Arachel, it is NOT providence.[LF]
It is not even a coincidence.[.][A][LF]
We agreed to meet here when we[LF]
planned out our battle strategy.[A][LF]
Wait[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Don't tell me that you[LF]
don't remember that![A]
[OpenMidRight]We planned this?[A][LF]
I suppose I simply don't usually[LF]
worry about such trifling details.[A][LF]
And here we are, so I suppose that[LF]
our plan must be working.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I suppose you're right.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Still, divine providence or not,[LF]
isn't it strange and wonderful?[.][A][LF]
A beautiful princess traveling with[.][LF]
such a ragged bunch as this[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
You could have told me much sooner,[.][LF]
you know![.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]My apologies.[.][A][LF]
Necessity demanded that I conceal[.][LF]
my identity at the time.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, it is no longer any worry.[A][LF]
To be honest, I believe I had figured out[.][LF]
your ruse from the very moment we met.[A][LF]
I said to myself, “This lovely woman[LF]
could only be of my own superior breeding.”[.][A][LF]
After all, you could never truly fool[.][LF]
a woman with my keen mind.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]My. How[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]impressive.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]There is something about nobility that[LF]
simply cannot be hidden from its kin![.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Why, Eirika, certainly you must have[LF]
felt the same thing upon seeing me?[.][A][LF]
You surely saw a refinement and grace of[LF]
carriage surpassing that of common folk?[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Err[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Aheh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Yes, why[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]the very first time[.][LF]
I met you, I could see that you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
You were very far from common.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Exactly. Far from common. I could[.][LF]
not have put it better myself.[A][LF]
It's simply impossible to travel[LF]
incognito these days.[.][A][X]

[OpenMidRight]L'Arachel?[.....][LF]
What are you doing?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm practicing! I want to be prepared[.][LF]
for when those fiends next show up.[.][A][LF]
You never can tell where or when[LF]
they'll appear, after all.[A][LF]
And if they were to appear and I were[.][LF]
unable to prepare a magical attack[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Well, I'd like to be ready to whack[.][LF]
them with this staff of mine.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Ahhh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Don't you think that's a[LF]
bit, well, dangerous?[.][A][LF]
Perhaps you should stop.[A][LF]
If monsters appear when I am around,[LF]
I promise I'll come to your aid.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's simply no good, Eirika. You[LF]
know how those monsters can be.[.][A][LF]
I insist that I be able to hold my[LF]
own, relying on nothing but my skills.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I've been curious about[.][LF]
something, L'Arachel[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Why are you so obsessed[.][LF]
with fighting monsters?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]My parents were kind people. I would[LF]
be like them if I am able.[A][LF]
My home of Rausten is so near to Darkling[.][LF]
Woods. We experienced many sudden raids.[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]My parents took it upon themselves to[.][LF]
defend our people against the monsters.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]I had no idea[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, but my parents are gone now.[.][A][LF]
I've been told that they passed away[LF]
when I was but an infant.[.][A][LF]
They[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]gave their lives defending[LF]
many helpless people.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm so sorry.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, you needn't be sad. I would[.][LF]
not want for that.[A][LF]
No, it's wonderful that they gave[.][LF]
their lives battling that filth.[A][LF]
I was so young that I do not remember[.][LF]
their faces, if I must be honest.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]However, that does not diminish the[.][LF]
pride I feel for what they've done.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Don't you feel lonely at[LF]
the loss of your parents?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]No! Not at all![.][A][LF]
What do you take me for?[LF]
Some kind of weakling?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I see that you are[LF]
strong indeed, L'Arachel.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]I should say so.[A][LF]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]would you not say that[LF]
you are strong, too, Eirika?[A][LF]
Your father stayed in his castle,[.][LF]
fighting the forces of Grado.[.][A][LF]
He had a noble death, don't[.][LF]
you think?[A][LF]
Your father was a great man.[A][LF]
You must be quite proud of him.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]yes.[A][LF]
He refused to take even one step in retreat[.][LF]
from the advancing Grado soldiers.[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]But still[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I mean, I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I would have thought no[.][LF]
less of him if he had fled.[.][A][LF]
Even if he were no longer a brave king[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
Still[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I would be happier if he were still alive.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CR][LF]
I do understand you.[A][LF]
Everyone would tell me of my parents'[.][LF]
bravery, of their honor[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
But I will never see them. I will[.][LF]
never know them for myself.[.][A][LF]
Oh, what I would give if I could have[.][LF]
met them[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]just once.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]What is it, L'Arachel?[A]
[OpenMidRight]About what we were discussing earlier[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I would not want you to get the wrong[.][LF]
idea.[.][A][LF]
I was not saying I was lonely because[.][LF]
my parents were dead.[.][A][LF]
I am not that weak, you know?[.][A][LF]
I have never even[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]cried[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]when[LF]

You are a very strong person.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidRight]I hope you do not think this[LF]
all too sudden, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Here. Look at this.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's this[.][ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]This ruby has been in Rausten for[.][LF]
generations. It is a valuable gem.[A][LF]
I would be honored if[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I would[.][LF]
like for you to have it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What? No, I couldn't! It's[LF]
far too precious to accept[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]No, I mean it. Please, accept[.][LF]
this as a gift.[.][A][LF]
Here.[.][A][LF]
I won't allow you to refuse.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]L'Arachel[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Thank you. I will treasure it.[A][LF]
I so wish I had something to give[.][LF]
you in return[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]You needn't feel that way.[LF]
Here, I've an idea[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Once we've put an end to all the[LF]
monstrosities in our lands[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Invite me to Renais. Does this[LF]
plan please you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]certainly. Of course.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Then we are agreed![.][A][LF]
Now, you had better not[.][LF]
go dying in battle on me.[.][A][LF]
Not until then, at any rate.[LF]
Do I have your word?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]let us both live long[.][LF]
enough to look back on this time.[.][A][LF]

it will be as the best of friends.[A][X]

And yes, I'd appreciate[.][LF]
the company.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I feel I should apologize.[A][LF]
I'm afraid I haven't been very[LF]

To be honest, I'm still in training,[LF]

You've been a great help to us.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidRight]Thank you, Eirika.[A][LF]
Heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I feel so foolish now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why is that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I look on you as a sister, Eirika.[A][LF]
And yet, even though we're the same[.][LF]
age, you seem so much more mature.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hardly[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]It is you who even gave me the[LF]
courage to leave the castle.[A][LF]
I wanted to be out on my own, like[LF]
you, to pattern my life after yours.[A][LF]

Listen to what he said to me![.][A][LF]
He told me that I was just in[.][LF]
everyone's way[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
He said I should just go back[.][LF]
home to Frelia[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]

He's always like that, too.[.][A][LF]
He just makes fun of me and[.][LF]
insults me and teases me.[.][A][LF]
I hate him so much![.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Tana, your brother has a strange[LF]
way of showing his concern[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
But he IS concerned about you.[LF]
You can see that, can't you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Even my brother gets angry at me when I[.][LF]
put myself at risk, even for a good cause.[A][LF]
Your brother is harsh and rough of speech,[LF]
but he doesn't want you to get hurt.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I suppose[.][LF]
you're right.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Why don't we go speak with him later?[.][A][LF]

Valega was most enlightening.[.][A][LF]
It sounds as though you align your[LF]

She spoke with the voice of nature,[.][LF]
and she lived at one with the earth.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But you called her a battle princess[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, in ancient times, Caer Pelyn[LF]
was invaded by a foreign nation.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]And leading the charge against the[LF]
invaders was Nada Kuya.[.][A][LF]
She carried a narrow sword made from a[LF]

[OpenMidLeft]No, no[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
When Grado invaded Renais, I was[LF]
paralyzed. I couldn't do anything.[A][LF]
It is only because of the sacrifices[LF]

His skill with sword and spear was[LF]
legendary. He was truly peerless.[.][A][LF]

chivalry watching him serve the king.[.][A][CR][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Ten years back, we received word that an[LF]
infamous assassin was hiding in Renais.[.][A][LF]

history of Renais. Your father.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I was so young when my father died.[.][A][LF]

Forde and I were almost always alone.[.][A][LF]
Oh, I remember how I used to cry like a[.][LF]

Forde would always remind me, “He is serving[LF]
the royal family to protect Renais.”[A][LF]
Forde was so proud of our father, but he[LF]
was also a little bit sad.[A][LF]
I remember a deep scar he had on his[LF]
shoulder, probably in battle.[.][A][LF]
My brother and I used to climb up his[.][LF]
shoulders and vie for his attention.[A][LF]
I grew up hearing what a great knight he[LF]
was, but I remember only his shoulder.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]You probably have no idea how[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, Seth.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, Cormag. Good timing.[A][LF]
I had something I wanted to ask you.[LF]
Your family, are they all soldiers?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Why do you ask?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Your skill with the spear is amazing.[.][LF]
Have you trained since you were a child?[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I come from a long line of dirt-poor[LF]
farmers. I wielded a plough, not a spear.[.][A][LF]
When we were kids, Glen and I had to[LF]
chase birds and animals from our fields.[A][LF]
We used sticks and stones, and I think[LF]
that helped with our aim, to be honest.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Is that so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
So why did you join the army?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's a funny story, really.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]The emperor's caravan passed through[LF]
our village one day.[A][LF]
My brother and I watched the glorious[.][LF]
procession from the top of a tree.[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Then, a stray dog started to harry the[LF]
horses pulling the emperor's carriage.[A][LF]
We threw rocks to drive off the mutt,[.][LF]
but some soldiers decided to arrest us.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Why? You were trying to help[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, well. We didn't just hit the dog.[LF]
We got a few of the soldiers as well.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah-ha[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
So, what happened next?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, the emperor shows up in the room[LF]
the soldiers had thrown us.[.][A][LF]
He looks around and, in this very calm[LF]
but stern voice, says to the soldiers:[A][LF]
"What are you men doing, arresting mere[.][LF]
children? They were trying to help!"[A][LF]
Then, he invites us to dine at his table,[.][LF]
and it was a luxurious feast, I tell you![.][A][LF]
Now, we were just kids. We lacked the[.][LF]
basic courtesies. We were just filthy.[A][LF]
And we kept droning on about the most[.][LF]
idiotic things: chores, the village[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
But he listened to us intently, and[.][LF]
that fatherly smile never left his face.[A][LF]
And he said, “You lads are good at[LF]
driving off dogs with stones[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Your skills are wasted in the fields. Let's[.][LF]
see how you fare with spears instead.”[A]
[OpenMidRight]And that's how you were recruited.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Exactly. It's difficult to ignore[.][LF]
such a commanding presence.[.][A][LF]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]the emperor changed. I still[LF]
can't believe what's happened.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I was born into a family of knights, so[.][LF]
it was a given that I should be one, too.[.][A][LF]
I trained in spear and sword. I studied[.][LF]
chivalry and swore my oaths of fealty.[A][LF]
And because of my hard work, the late[.][LF]
King Fado treated me like a second son.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]It's funny. You and I are from different[LF]
worlds, but we share the same loyalties.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]True[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
But King Fado is dead now.[A][LF]
And my emperor is the one[.][LF]
who killed him[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
My emperor is as good[.][LF]
as dead to me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I already serve a new lord.[.][A][LF]

worthy of your loyalties, too.[A]

[OpenMidRight]What?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I still don't understand why Grado[LF]

Grado and Renais were allies. Their royal[.][LF]
families were close friends.[A][LF]
Why, Prince Ephraim and Princess Eirika[.][LF]
are friends with your Prince Lyon.[A][LF]
I detect something funny here.[A][LF]
I simply cannot believe a friendship[LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Oh, I'm sorry. I don't mean to[LF]

I was born in a rural village and[.][LF]
raised in Grado's countryside.[A][LF]
Ever since I was a little child,[LF]

Grado, of course, is named after the[LF]

different than all that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Amelia[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]

[ToggleSmile]It was wrong of Grado to invade[.][LF]
Renais. Nothing can justify it.[.][A][LF]
Grado has no right to destroy whole[.][LF]
nations, ruin people's lives.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Neimi, I wanted to ask about your[.][LF]
vision-training regimen.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, where I stare into the[LF]
distance and concentrate?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. I've been trying it out[LF]
myself, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I've had some problems.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Problems?[.][LF]
What do you mean?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Whenever I'm training, people[.][LF]
start to avoid me.[A][LF]
It's not just that. Even animals[LF]
run away from me when I'm at it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]And you're just[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You're just[.][LF]
staring into the distance?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. Standing perfectly still,[LF]
staring into the distance.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Maybe it's[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]because you look[LF]
scary[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I used to get that a lot.[.][A][LF]
Cormag said I was frightening him.[LF]
He thought I was angry at him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I look[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]scary? Hm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I have refined my stare to intimidate[.][LF]
my foes in battle. You may have a point.[A][LF]
No wonder people get scared when they[.][LF]
see me glowering into the distance.[.][A][LF]
You know, I might almost consider it[LF]
a compliment of my knightly prowess![A]
[OpenMidRight]I have an idea[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps if you[LF]
[ToggleSmile]smile, it might not be so scary.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Like this?[A][ToggleSmile]

[OpenMidLeft]It's still scary, isn't it?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Maybe it's because you're[.][LF]
crossing your arms.[.][A][LF]
How about[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]holding some flowers[LF]

[OpenMidLeft]You want me to stare into the distance[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]

## MSG_0C9F
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][FID_0x07]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][FID_0x08]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, do you have time[LF]
for that story I promised?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Certainly, Father.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It was over ten years ago, when[.][LF]
the prince was just a child.[A][LF]
There was a ceremony at the castle,[.][LF]
with a trick archer of sorts.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]A trick archer?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. He was a very famous and undeniably[LF]
skilled archer from abroad.[.][A][LF]
He was to shoot a tiny target that had[LF]
been placed in the distance.[A][LF]
However, in the middle of the show,[.][LF]
someone stopped him from shooting.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, no[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It wasn't[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, it was young Prince Innes.[.][A][LF]
He said, “That's not far enough![LF]
Move the target back farther!”[A][LF]
Then, he insisted on trying himself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's so like him![.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Isn't it?[.][LF]
[ToggleSmile]King Hayden tried to stop him, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Well, you know how he is.[.][LF]
He doesn't listen to anyone.[A][LF]
And so, it became a contest between our[.][LF]
prince and this foreign archer.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]So, what happened?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]First, they established the ground rules.[.][A][LF]
Each person was to shoot at the target. If[LF]
both arrows hit, they increased the range.[A][LF]
They simply continued to move the target[LF]
back until one person missed the mark.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sounds simple enough.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, but the two were evenly matched.[LF]
Every shot was a perfect bull's-eye.[A][LF]
The crowd cheered, and the target[.][LF]
moved ever farther back[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
But then it came to the turning point.[LF]
The foreign archer said, [.][A][LF]
“This is no test. Let's move the[LF]
target back more.”[A][LF]
It seemed like bravado, but the archer[LF]
actually had a clever tactic in mind.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Clever? How so?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]They had been shooting for some time,[.][LF]
and the archer's arms had grown weary.[A][LF]
Precision archery is far more taxing[LF]
than the battlefield, you see.[A][LF]
So even though he was a skilled archer,[.][LF]
he was at the limits of his endurance.[A][LF]
He was still hitting the mark accurately,[.][LF]
but his arm was quivering more and more.[A][LF]
Everyone knew that the prince was[.][LF]
on the verge of victory.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't understand. They were shooting at[.][LF]
the same target, shot for shot, right?[A][LF]
Why would moving the target make any[LF]
difference?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, they were still shooting at the[LF]
same target.[A][LF]
However, the archer suggested that they[.][LF]
move the target much farther away[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Much farther than any child Innes's age[.][LF]
could hope to loose an arrow to.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, that IS clever![.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Even the archer, with his trained arms,[.][LF]
was firing at his maximum range.[A][LF]
In fact, he almost missed the target![.][A][LF]
Then, it was the prince's turn.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]And[.][ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]It was clearly too far away for the[.][LF]
young prince to hit the target.[.][A][LF]
But His Highness was undeterred. He drew[LF]
his string and fired up into the sky.[.][A][LF]
The arrow did not merely hit the target.[LF]
No, it was a perfect bull's-eye![A][LF]
You see, the prince arced his shot[LF]
to extend his range beyond its limits.[A][LF]
To hit a target this way requires[.][LF]
incredible skill, but the prince did it.[A][LF]
And then he turned to the archer and said,[LF]
“Shall we move the target back farther?”[A][LF]
The archer looked so crestfallen. He[LF]
admitted defeat, and it was settled.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's amazing[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]That it is.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you very much, Father[.][LF]
Moulder! That's incredible![.][A][LF]
I'm even more[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]More[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]what?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
No, nothing.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]So[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Last night was a new moon.[LF]
And that means today is the day.[A][LF]
I've been going mad wondering,[LF]
Syrene. What is your suggestion?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, right you are, Father. It is[LF]
indeed the promised day.[A][LF]
Well, then. On behalf of everyone,[LF]
I have two words for you.[.][A][LF]
Father Moulder?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Y-yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Happy Birthday![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]What? Birthday?[.][A][LF]
Oh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Oh, yes! Why, today is[LF]
my birthday, isn't it? But[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It is a fine tradition to celebrate[.][LF]
one's birthday, Father.[.][A][LF]
In a war, uncertainty surrounds us[LF]
every moment of every day.[A][LF]
Instead of worrying about tomorrow,[.][LF]
let us celebrate life today.[A][LF]
That should encourage us all to[.][LF]
keep going, wouldn't you say?[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, indeed. To share the joys of life[LF]
is very important.[A][LF]
Thank you, Syrene. In this chaos, I[.][LF]
would have forgotten my own birthday.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]You exhaust yourself caring for others,[.][LF]
but you pay no attention to yourself.[.][A][LF]
We are all so grateful to you, Father.[A][LF]
So many different people came up to me[LF]
to ask how we could show that gratitude.[A][LF]
You are a man of great virtue, and[LF]
an inspiration to us all.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am touched[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
At my age, I thought all my happy[.][LF]
birthdays were well behind me.[A][LF]

Mother and I were so panicked that [.][LF]

You were the youngest of us all,[A][LF]

And this here is Titania. We're both [.][LF]
pleased to meet you, Lute.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, the pegasus, the proud, winged horse.[.][A][LF]
You know, they only attach to someone they[LF]
accept as their master.[.][A][LF]
And did you know that pegasi fly by kicking[.][LF]
the air, not by flapping their wings.[.][A][LF]
It's a common misconception, but wings[LF]
are mainly used for gliding.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Yes, as captain, I learned all[LF]
this long ago. [.][A][LF]
Plus, if they flapped their wings constantly,[.][LF]
no one would be able to ride them.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]In some countries, the word pegasus [LF]
means “fountain” or “ocean.”[A][LF]
Different cultures have different stories[.][LF]
about the creation of the pegasus.[A][LF]
In one legend, there was a monster who[LF]

breakfast “first break.”[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]A fast what? Huh? Speak plainly! I don't[LF]

This means that breakfast is an [LF]
especially important meal.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh. Who would have thunk it?[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]The only thing I consumed this[LF]
morning was knowledge![A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean?[.][A]

bring myself to bury this, though.[A][LF]

it? You'd make better use of it.[A][LF]

[OpenMidRight]Hey, you![.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I hope that maniac isn't talking to me.[.][LF]
I'll pretend I can't hear him. La la la.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You, over there! Mage woman![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you talking to me? Firstly, my name[.][LF]
isn't “Mage Woman,” nor is it “You.”[A][LF]
Why don't you lower your voice and[LF]
act a little more civilized? Who are you?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm son of the warrior Garcia, Ross.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]So you're “Son-of-warrior-garcia-ross.”[.][LF]
That's an unusual name. [A][LF]
I'm Lute, genius mage extraordinaire. [LF]
You've probably heard of me.[A][LF]
So, Sir Son-of-warrior-garcia-ross, [LF]
how may I be of service to you?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
[OpenMidRight]My name is ROSS! You're kind of weird.[.....][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Hey, you can use magic, right?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, although to be more accurate,[LF]
I don't just “use” magic.[.][A][LF]
I am a master of all magic. [LF]
Please don't make that mistake again.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wow, that's really great.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, maybe for you. For me, I'm[LF]
just that good. It's normal.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Isn't it hard to remember all those spells?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I think for the average person,[.][LF]
it probably is a difficult task.[A][LF]
But for me, it is as simple as using a[LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Well, nothing in particular. I just thought[.][LF]
we could chat[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]or something.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, THAT doesn't sound very productive [.][LF]
nor strategically important, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
If you want to, please go ahead.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]OK. Um. Let's see. What to talk about.[.....][LF]
You know, my mom used a little magic, too.[A][LF]
She passed away a while ago[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
But, that's why I thought I might be able[.][LF]
to use magic, too.[A][LF]
Last time, you said no right away, but[LF]
you hadn't heard the whole story.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you want to be a mage?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, not exactly.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, then you should keep following [.][LF]
your own instinct instead.[A][LF]
Everyone has his or her own talent.[.][A][LF]
I figure the path you are taking now is [LF]
appropriate for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Maybe you're right.[.][A][LF]
Well, it's not like I was torn between [.][LF]
the two or anything.[A][LF]
I kinda just wanted to talk with [.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]OK, here it is.[.][LF]
Ross, do you know what a balance is?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course I do! Who doesn't?[A][LF]
It's a type of scale with small plates[LF]

it balances.[A][LF]
So that was the riddle? Easy![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha! You're too funny! No, that was [.][LF]
just the setup for the brainteaser.[.][A][LF]
Here's the real question.[.][LF]
Assume there are 25 pebbles.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Pebbles?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, they're really small. As small as peas.[LF]
They are all the same color and shape.[A][LF]
In this group, there's one pebble that's[LF]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]And I must tell you the way to [.][LF]
find that pebble?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course not. [.][LF]
What kind of challenge is that?[.][A][LF]
The question is, how many times do you need[.][LF]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]How many times? Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
It's not[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]24, is it?[A][ToggleSmile]

[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh! Ha ha ha ha ha![.][LF]

[OpenMidRight]Hey, you![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, hi, Ross.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I have an answer for your brainteaser![A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]You got it, huh? That's amazing![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Y-yeah.[.][LF]
The answer is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, yes?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Four times![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]You must have worked really hard to figure[LF]
that out![.][A]
[OpenMidRight]See! See! I told you I'd get it![LF]
Fighting's not the only thing I'm good at.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]However, that's not the correct answer.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What do you mean?[.][LF]
I can't believe it! Ugh![A][LF]
If that's not the right answer, then [.][LF]
what is?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]You were close. [LF]
The right answer is three times.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Only three times?[.][LF]
How? Tell me![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]The key is how many pebbles you put on the[LF]
scales at first.[A][LF]
First, put eight rocks each on either side [.][LF]
of the scale.[.][A][LF]
The side with the lighter rock will be[LF]
higher than the other, right?[.][A][LF]
Or, if the sides are balanced, it means that[LF]
the lighter rock is in the rest of the pile.[A][LF]
So that was one turn on the balance. [.][LF]
The rest is pretty easy to figure out.[A][LF]
Let's assume that the lighter rock was[LF]
in the remaining pile of nine rocks[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Then you'd put three rocks on each side of[LF]
the scale. So that's the second turn.[.][A][LF]
If either side of the scale tips, then[LF]
the rock is in one of those two piles.[A][LF]
If the scale is balanced, then the rock[.][LF]
is one of the remaining three rocks.[A][LF]
So, now you've figured out which group[LF]
of three pebbles has the lighter one.[.][A][LF]
What you do now is put one rock from this[.][LF]
pile on each side of the scale.[.][A][LF]
Like before, if the scale tips to one side, [LF]
the lighter pebble is on the scale.[.][A][LF]
If the scale is balanced, then the[LF]
remaining pebble is the lighter one.[A][LF]
And that was the last turn on the[.][LF]
scale. Did you get all that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh? Well, I think I got it[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]What?! I just explained it all very clearly.[LF]
You still don't get it? That's really[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]

[OpenMidLeft]Um, nothing. Forget it. A ha ha ha ha![A]

[OpenMidRight]My father is such an amazing warrior.[.][A][LF]
I've always wanted to be worthy of[LF]
the title “son of Garcia.”[A][LF]
And I want to be able to go home and [.][LF]

After that, I want to go on a voyage and[LF]

[OpenMidRight]Ross, didn't you say that you wanted to go [.][LF]
on an ocean voyage to train yourself?[.][A][LF]
The sea is a great place to train because[.][LF]
it strengthens both the mind and body.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Have you ever been on a voyage?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course. I've escorted many commercial [.][LF]
ships before.[.][A][LF]
It's embarrassing, but I got seasick for [.][LF]
the first few days.[.][A][LF]
That was very painful.[LF]
But I got used to it in a few days.[.][A][LF]
It was a long trip. Nature was more brutal[LF]
than the enemies who pursued us.[A][LF]
But after the voyage ended, I realized that[.][LF]
I grew up a lot.[A][LF]
The sea is an amazing combination of [.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Now I definitely want to go on a [.][LF]

[OpenMidRight]What is it, Ross? You seem down today.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why is the sword stronger than the axe?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]What are you talking about?[.][LF]
Just use a stronger axe to beat a sword.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's not what I mean![.][A][LF]
I want to be strong enough to split[.][LF]
a silver sword with an iron axe.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Your father[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]What about him?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]He could defeat many swordsmen[LF]
with just one axe.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you've seen him in battle?[.][A]

He was leading a unit of the Renais army.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wow, my dad was really strong, wasn't he![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]He was more than just strong. [LF]
He was like a war god.[A][LF]
I have to be honest with you, Ross.[.][LF]
I was on his enemy side at the time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?![A]
[OpenMidRight]I was a mercenary hired by the other side.[A][LF]
It was a fierce battle against Garcia's[.][LF]
unit, and we ultimately had to retreat.[.][A][LF]
Come to think of it, this is a perfect [.][LF]
example of the power of the mind.[.][A][LF]
You see, I was so intimidated by Garcia that[LF]
I had lost even before I started.[.][A][LF]
That was an unforgettable failure for me.[.][A][LF]
After that, I swore to myself that I would [.][LF]
be as strong as him with a sword.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wow, I can't believe Dad beat you down [.][LF]

But you're pretty great, too.[.][A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah![.][A][LF]
You might have lost that time, but you [.][LF]
became a great swordsman because of it![.][A][LF]
OK. I'm going to stop moping around.[A][LF]
From this moment on, I swear that someday [LF]
I will destroy swords with my axe.[A][LF]
You are my witness, Sir Gerik![A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Truly, you are the son[LF]
of the warrior Garcia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's not all! I'm also the best student of[LF]

that there is a woman sword fighter here.[.][A][LF]
Apparently, she's very talented and was [LF]
hired for an unbelievable sum.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]A woman sword fighter??[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Rumor is that if you speak to her[.][LF]
without thinking,[.][A][LF]
she's likely to attack you out of nowhere![A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Is that so.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Maybe her face is scarred from[LF]
fighting. Yeah, that's probably it![.][A][LF]
She's beautiful, but has a very sad[.][LF]
past behind that scar.[A][LF]
And that's why she's so scary![A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]A scarred face?[.][LF]
A sad past?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Or maybe it's because her lover was[.][LF]
killed, and she's trying to avenge him.[.][A][LF]
That seems equally plausible, doesn't it?[.][A][LF]
Anyway, if you see her around, would you [.][LF]
tell her that I was looking for her?[A][LF]
See ya.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I'm the only female sword fighter[.][LF]
here. I guess he was looking for me.[A][LF]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, nothing special.[A][LF]
I just wanted to meet the famous[LF]

[OpenMidLeft]My father.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Your father?![.][A]

[OpenMidLeft]He was one of the most famous swordsmen [LF]
in Jehanna. He was also a mercenary.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see why you're so good.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Ever since I was a child, my father [LF]

[OpenMidRight]Since you were a kid?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]The harsh conditions of Jehanna breed[.][LF]
strength and ruthlessness.[A][LF]
The only way to survive is by being [LF]
a mercenary.[ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]Oh.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]My father is my parent, my teacher, and [LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Once I conquer the mountain, I can[LF]
accomplish anything I want.[.][A]

Those rags are a dead giveaway.[.][A][LF]
Well, you may not take any pride in your[LF]

Do you see this jacket?[.][A][LF]
It has silk embroidery, a trend that [.][LF]
I started in Carcino.[.][A][LF]
Where are the stitches, you ask?[A][LF]
They're on the inside of the jacket.[LF]
But I'm not going to show you.[A][LF]

[ToggleSmile]I heard that your dad is a wealthy [.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Yes. So what?[.][A][LF]
My father is a wealthy merchant,[LF]
and his son is a thief.[.][A][LF]
Great family, huh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If you're rich, you don't need to steal.[LF]
You can just buy whatever you want.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]You are so green, boy. Greener than the [LF]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's that supposed to mean?[.][A][LF]
I've never had dried fruit, so I don't[LF]
know what you're talking about![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, that's too bad.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Listen, urchin. Merchants are always[LF]
stingy. It's part of who they are.[A][LF]
And my father was especially stingy. [.][LF]
He gave us nothing for free.[A][LF]
We had to work for everything we had.[.][A][LF]
So my brothers and I learned the value of[.][LF]
hard work from a young age.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]And this just happens to be my job.[.][LF]
Get it?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's not easy being the son of a [.][LF]
merchant, huh?[A][LF]
Forced to work from a young age.[LF]
I had a tough childhood, too. [A][LF]
I always had to hunt and garden with [.][LF]
my dad.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]I guess our lives aren't so different [LF]
after all, huh.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Er, a little hunting and gardening [.][LF]
is quite different from actual work.[A][LF]
You can see that just by looking[LF]
at how you and I turned out.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well! I'll show you![A][LF]
Maybe you'll wake up one morning and find[.][LF]
that something important to you is gone![A][LF]
Consider yourself warned, old man![A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]You know,[.][A][LF]

So, how's that for stealth? That's some[.][LF]
pretty fine thieving, if I do say so myself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see. The embroidery IS missing.[.][LF]
Good work.[A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh? Yeah[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Unfortunately for you, that was a fake.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I've been asking around since[.][LF]
the last time we spoke.[.][A][LF]
I found out that our convoy master had[LF]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
You know, when I was looking for[LF]
your mirror, I was reminded[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I had a similar experience when I was[.][LF]
young. It's why I chose to be a monk.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[OpenEyes]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What happened?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]One day, when I was just a little boy,[LF]
I had lost a toy, and I was crying.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]I lived near a monastery, and one of[LF]
the monks saw me sitting there weeping.[.][A][LF]
He spent his day trying to find out why[.][LF]
I was so sad and to cheer me up.[A][LF]
It was so trivial--that toy was nothing[.][LF]
but a trinket, but to me, it had value.[.][A][LF]
I later found out a friend of mine[LF]
had taken it without asking, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Anyway, I was very happy that someone[.][LF]
had stopped to show so much concern.[A][LF]
To everyone else, I was just a petty[LF]
child weeping over a toy.[.][A][LF]
To this monk, however, I was a sad and[LF]
lost soul, crying out in need.[A][LF]
He was so kind, and he spent so much[LF]
of his day on a child's tears.[A][LF]
I admired his attitude, even then.[A][LF]
It was then that I realized that I could[LF]
honor his deed by becoming a monk.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]that's why[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, that's why.[A][LF]

[OpenRight]Thank you.[A][LF]
You know, when you meet someone, that[.][LF]
person reflects back at you[.][A][LF]

the emotions that you project.[A][LF]
Angry people bring out the anger within[.][LF]
others, just as sullen, hopeless people[.][A][LF]
bring out nothing but the sorrow within[.][LF]
all those to whom they speak.[.][A][LF]
Do you know why so many people seem[.][LF]

[OpenMidRight]You spent most of your time sequestered[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Of course! There are so many fascinating[LF]

There are a great many books out there,[.][LF]

But I've found that what is written can[.][LF]
differ greatly from how things truly are.[.][A][LF]
Take this chemida beetle, for example.[A][LF]
I've been reading from “The Glossary[LF]
of Falibrian Entomology” lately.[A][LF]
According to the glossary, their wings[LF]
fall off once they reach maturity.[A][LF]
However, I have just found an adult[.][LF]
beetle whose wings still work perfectly![A][LF]
Exceptions do exist to the rules my[.][LF]

[OpenMidRight]Do you remember when I loaned[.][LF]
you my copy of “Lux Aeterna”?[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidRight]And! Knowing full well that I[.][LF]
have a[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]mild[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]fear of spiders,[A][LF]
you caught a small army of them[.][LF]
and unleashed them in my room![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I thought that if I immersed[LF]
you in the thing you feared,[A][LF]
maybe you might be able to[LF]
overcome your fear entirely![A][LF]
And I went to a lot of trouble[LF]

Oh, and I hear music helps you sleep.[.][LF]

do you win?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, now, you have to[LF]
do whatever I tell you.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
[OpenMidRight]What? Why do you say that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You lost, right?[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Since you lost, you've got[LF]
to do what I tell you.[A][LF]
So when this battle's over,[.][LF]
I want you to train with me.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Train? What are you talking about?[A][LF]
Look, I only said heads because[.][LF]
you pressed me to![A][LF]
I don't remember you saying anything[LF]
about what we were betting on.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You shouldn't worry so much[.][LF]
about the tiny details![.][A][LF]
You'll waste your life, worrying[LF]
so much! Now, about that training.[A][CR][LF]
I always have a tough time fighting[.][LF]
against people who use magic.[.][A][LF]
I think it's got something to[.][LF]
do with getting the timing right[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I don't really need to polish my[LF]
technique too much.[.][A][LF]
However, I've noticed that these[LF]
battles just keep getting harder.[.][A][LF]
So, I figured I should train with[.][LF]
someone who can use a little magic![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]I commend your attitude, but[LF]
I really can't help you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]

I hope you're not too exhausted[.][LF]
for today's training session.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, actually[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
Could we not do this today?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Hey, now. Show a little[.][LF]

[ToggleSmile]An attitude like that ain't[.][LF]
gonna win you any battles![A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]You may be right, but I just[LF]

training, I'll be no good[.][A][LF]

I'm trying not to let it show,[LF]
but I'm really worn out today.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then let's make a bet.[LF]
If I win, you do what I tell you.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Joshua, I'm quite drained, and[LF]
we still have much fighting to do.[A][LF]
You should just rest tonight.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't worry about me, Artur.[LF]
So, heads or tails?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Fine[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Heads.[.][A]

[ToggleSmile]Listen, just take a day off.[LF]
Get some rest, all right?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]But I lost the bet.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The deal was, if I win,[.][LF]
you do what I tell you.[.][A][LF]
And what I'm telling you[LF]
to do is take it easy.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Joshua[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]

I've never done much fighting.[LF]
I think I'm just worn out.[A][LF]
It's exhausting, having to keep[.][LF]
your guard up all the time.[.][A][LF]
But your kindness has rejuvenated[.][LF]
my frazzled nerves a little.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Well, we're still fighting, so[LF]
don't let your guard down.[A][LF]
Stick close to me today, and[LF]

[OpenMidRight]Hey, Artur! You're looking pretty[.][LF]

Care to make a bet?[.][A][LF]
If I win, we'll hit the training[LF]
again tonight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No need for bets, Joshua.[.][LF]
I'll be happy to train with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're volunteering?[A][LF]
Are you feeling all right? Did[LF]
you take a blow to the head?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, no. I'm fine. I'm just[LF]
offering to help you out.[.][A][LF]
It's easier than losing[.][LF]
another bet to you.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean? You've[LF]
got even odds of winning.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]You must be joking![.][A][LF]
Out of the past 21 coin flips,[LF]
I've won two, and you've won 19![A][LF]
Those are impossible odds to beat,[LF]
so there's only one answer.[.][A][LF]
You must have some divine[.][LF]
betting power or something.[.][A][LF]
If I can help you train, I will,[LF]
but I don't want to lose anymore.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Hmph[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
But that's no fun![A][LF]
All right, you don't have to train[LF]
with me if you don't want to bet.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Excuse me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't have any divine power.[A][LF]
You've won 11 out of 21 coin tosses[.][LF]
so far. We're about even.[.][A][LF]
I was[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]cheating. Just[LF]
a little, though.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]You cheated? I felt so guilty[.][LF]
when I accused you earlier.[.][A][LF]
I guess I just trusted--[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yep. That's your problem.[.][A][LF]
I know trust and faith are[LF]
important to you monkly types.[A][LF]
However, on the battlefield,[LF]
you can never trust your foe.[.][A][LF]
If we were gambling for your[LF]
life, and not for training,[.][A][LF]
you'd be dead 19 times over.[A][LF]
Well, I mean, you can only die[LF]
once, but you get my drift.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....][LF]
I'm speechless[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha. Good thing I'm[LF]
a reasonably fair man, huh?[.][A][LF]
No harm done, and you even learned[LF]
a little something, didn't you?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]I suppose.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So here's the deal. I want[LF]
you to keep being my partner.[.][A][LF]
But this time, I'll be teaching[.][LF]
you a little bit about wagers.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]What's more important to you, Joshua?[.][.....][LF]
Gambling or training?[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]I guess I don't even have to ask[LF]
you that, huh? But no more cheating![A][ToggleSmile][X]

[OpenMidRight]I beg your pardon.[A][LF]

Kyle, of the Knights of Renais.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, I see. And I am Lute, mage[LF]

[OpenMidRight]Very well, Lute.[LF]
The pleasure is mine.[.][A][LF]
To tell you the truth, I've[.][LF]

[OpenMidRight]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]guess it would be that last one.[LF]
I have a favor to ask.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What would it be?[.][A][LF]
My requests are classified into[.][LF]
seven categories and 25 items.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't know how it would be classified,[LF]
but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I want you to help us fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm a strong believer that morale is[LF]
best served by good leadership.[.][A][LF]
A unit of knights, all trained[LF]
by Renais's finest generals.[A][LF]
But we're fighting no ordinary foe,[.][LF]
and we need more diverse skills.[A][LF]
That's where you come in.[.][A][LF]
Because you can use magic, you[LF]
could be invaluable in helping me[.][A][LF]
develop unique battle strategies.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]So that's what you wanted[.][LF]
me for, is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]How about it? Would you do it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sure. Anything you say.[.][LF]
I don't mind.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]I should warn you, I spend my[.][LF]
time on the front line.[.][A][LF]
I ride out to meet the enemy head-[LF]
on rather than attacking from afar.[.][A][LF]
It's a much riskier prospect than[.][LF]
supporting from the rear guard.[.][A][LF]
Is that going to be a problem?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have no objections.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Excellent! I appreciate your help.[A][LF]
I expect we'll be able to generate[LF]
some stunning tactics together.[.][A][LF]
You don't need to stay at the front[.][LF]
the whole time.[.][A][LF]
I'll give you a cue when to approach.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Got it.[.][A][LF]
I'll do whatever you say.[.][A]

[OpenMidRight]I know you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] You're[.][LF]
Natasha, from the temple.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. I remember seeing you[LF]
many times back in Grado.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]But this is the first time[LF]
we've ever actually spoken.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't know what it is, but clerics and[LF]
mages seem to be like oil and water.[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]And we mages can be an enigmatic bunch[LF]
at times. Shadowy and sinister[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Or at least, that's how I've always[.][LF]
imagined you clerics saw us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, no! I never--[.][A][LF]
Well, no. You're right. We had few[LF]
dealings with the mages.[A][LF]
But that's in the past. I have[LF]
a question for you, Master Knoll.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]I think I can guess. It's about the[.][LF]
Sacred Stones and Prince Lyon, is it?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is.[A][LF]
My mentor died[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]trying to warn us about[.][LF]
the threat our Sacred Stone posed.[A][LF]
I want to know the truth.[.][A][LF]
What is Emperor Vigarde up to? What[.][LF]
is Prince Lyon's role in this?[A]
[OpenMidRight]There are as many truths out there[LF]
as there are people to tell them.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Perhaps it's best simply to choose the[LF]
truth with which you are most comfortable.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]In the eyes of your mentor, I would[.][LF]
imagine we must have seemed quite evil.[.][A][LF]
He imagined our magical studies using[.][LF]
the Sacred Stone were sacrilege.[A][LF]
I suspect he quite loathed the[LF]
ancient magics he called “dark.”[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're wrong[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]
[OpenLeft]My mentor wasn't like that at all![A][LF]
And isn't this war the direct result[LF]
of all your dark magic research?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Well, I suppose[LF]
you are right about that.[.][A][LF]
Your magic stems from faith in the[LF]
unknowable, the divine presence.[A][LF]
In contrast, dark magic stems from[LF]
knowledge, from understanding.[A][LF]
We distrust what we do not understand,[LF]
and we strive to know the unknowable.[.][A][LF]
Perhaps our disciplines truly[.][LF]
are incompatible.[.][A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][FID_0x29]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Our researches ended in[.][LF]
miserable failure.[A][LF]
Grado's Sacred Stone was shattered.[.][LF]
Prince Lyon, corrupted[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
And this whole tragedy that unfolds[.][LF]
around us even now.[.][A][LF]
It's true. We mages have triggered[LF]
this age's greatest calamity.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]But why? What was it all for?[.][A][LF]
What did you hope to accomplish[.][LF]
with the power of the Sacred Stone?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]All Prince Lyon wanted was to help[LF]
people[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]and we are his servants.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Help people?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We read of a spell entitled the time shear.[.][LF]
It causes, in effect, a hole in time.[.][A][LF]
This spell warps time, punches a[LF]
hole through cause and effect.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]We lack the knowledge to reproduce[LF]
this ancient spell today.[.][A][LF]
Prince Lyon, however, was convinced[.][LF]
that we could unravel its secret.[.][A][LF]
He felt we could use it to predict--[LF]
and even prevent--future events.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Prevent[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]the future?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, we dedicated years to studying[LF]
this spell.[.][A][LF]
You see, the greater the disaster, the[LF]
farther it sends ripples through time.[A][LF]
We learned to read these ripples from[.][LF]
the future, hoping to save lives.[.][A][LF]
If we could know when a disaster would[LF]
strike, we could evacuate people.[.][A][LF]
We could save millions of lives.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][A][LF]
It seems so, so blasphemous.[A][LF]
That worldly creatures should[.][LF]
take control of fate, it--[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]Are you saying that, knowing the[LF]
future, we should do nothing?[.][A][LF]
We should simply allow people to[LF]
die in order to preserve “fate”?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry. I don't mean to[LF]
sound hostile.[A][LF]
Prince Lyon himself was troubled[LF]
by these same doubts, you see.[A][LF]
But we pressed on with our studies.[.][A][LF]
We felt it was our duty, in the[.][LF]
interest of all Grado's people.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Perhaps we were bitter that we[LF]
receive no credit for aiding Grado.[.][A][LF]
That we receive no accolades for our[LF]
research, for the benefit it brings.[A][LF]
I do not know. But we pressed on,[.][LF]
nonetheless.[A][LF]
The misconceptions linking the ancient[LF]
magics to “evil” die hard and slow.[.][A][LF]
Prince Lyon sought to change that.[A][LF]
He wanted, as we all wanted, to[.][LF]
prove that our magic had good uses.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Prince Lyon would never--[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]With our aid, Prince Lyon predicted[.][LF]
a great storm rising in the south.[A][LF]
He barred ships from leaving port,[LF]
and, oh, how the people complained.[.][A][LF]
But the storm came, and the seas[LF]
raged. We saved countless lives.[A][LF]
And Prince Lyon cared not at all[LF]
if the people loved him for it.[.][A][LF]
He only wanted them to be safe.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]And now, I see it all so clearly.[.][LF]
All our research amounts to nothing.[A][LF]
All I can do now is lament our[LF]
hunger for knowledge. Our greed.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft]How-- How can this--[A]
[OpenMidRight]I advise you to leave Grado.[A][LF]
You might be able to escape the disaster[LF]
if you head north to Renais or Frelia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
I can't do that.[A][LF]
When this disaster strikes, people[LF]
will need help and healing.[.][A][LF]
If I could help them even a little[LF]
by staying behind[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]You would willingly risk certain[LF]
death to save a handful of people?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If I died serving Grado, I would[LF]
have no regrets, Master Knoll.[A][LF]
Thank you for sharing this. I will[LF]

Spoken like a true cleric.[A][LF]

hesitation just to help others.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Master Knoll?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]If I am to honor Prince Lyon's[LF]
intentions, I cannot flee this.[.][A][LF]

So[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] What do you say to a[.][LF]
starter bet of[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]1,000?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Betting? Here? You can't be serious.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey now. I always take gambling[.][LF]
seriously. Always.[A][LF]
Whether you live or die on the[LF]
field often comes down to luck.[.][A][LF]
Every fight, you're putting your[LF]
life in someone else's hands.[.][A][LF]
You should be glad to meet up[.][LF]
with such a lucky guy.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]You may rely on luck, but[.][LF]
I prefer raw skill.[.][A][LF]
However, we might as well. Put[LF]
your money where your mouth is.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Now you're talking![.][A][LF]
Right, here we go![A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidLeft][......][ToggleSmile]Heads or tails?[.][LF]
What's your call?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Tails.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Let's see what we've got[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Oh, well. It's heads.[.][A][LF]
Too bad, Your Highness. You lost.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]What? That's impossible.[LF]
I saw--[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]C'est la vie.[.][A][LF]
Look closely. See? It's heads.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]That's strange[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
My eyes never fail me, but[LF]
I could have sworn--[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Hm. There seems to be more to[.][LF]
betting than meets the eye.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Figure that out already?[LF]
You're a quick study.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah.[.][A][LF]
Let's try that again.[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Heads again.[A][LF]
That's ten losses in a row.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't care. Next bet.[.][LF]
Double or nothing. Tails.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Shouldn't you stop soon?[A][LF]
Maybe you've got the cash back[LF]
home, but you're on the road.[.][A][LF]
And I'm willing to bet you're[.][LF]
not carrying that much on you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, keep going.[.][A][LF]
I don't feel like quitting[LF]
on a bad streak.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fine, fine[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
But then can we call[LF]
it quits?[.][A][LF]
You've let me win enough, and[.][LF]
I don't want to bleed you dry.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No. I won't let you leave, not[LF]
while you're still ahead.[.][A][LF]
Hurry up. We don't have the[.][LF]
luxury of time here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What's that saying? The cooler[LF]
the head, the hotter he bets?[.][A][LF]
Something like that. And you seem[.][LF]
pretty cool most of the time.[.][A][LF]

## MSG_0CF7
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][FID_0x2A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][FID_0x0F]
[OpenMidRight]Thanks for waiting.[.][LF]
Let's get started.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You can't be serious.[.][LF]
You want to keep going?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Just flip the coin.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Oh, brother.[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Your Highness, I have a little[LF]
admission to make here.[.][A][LF]
You have no chance of winning.[LF]
The whole thing is rigged.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Rigged[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah. You flip the coin[.][LF]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]like this.[A][LF]
Then catch it in the hand.[A][LF]
I'm the one holding the coin.[.][A][LF]
I can turn it over any way I choose[.][LF]
just by moving my palm a bit.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Like this.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Hmm[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]That's how you did it[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I knew you were up to something.[A][LF]
It was straining my disbelief that[LF]
you could keep winning like that.[.][A][LF]
Strange that I couldn't catch[.][LF]
on to your little trick, though.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's nice of you to say, but[LF]
I'm sure you must have suspected.[.][A][LF]
There's a guy who hangs out near[LF]
a pub in Jehanna. He's real smooth.[.][A][LF]
His secret is to mix in just enough[.][LF]
losses to make it look plausible.[.][A][LF]
If you ever go there, you'll know[.][LF]
the guy I'm talking about right away.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Interesting. I've never had any[.][LF]
experience with this sort of thing.[.][A][LF]
One only has so much time when he's[.][LF]
groomed to become the king, you know.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I can imagine.[A][LF]
But a king must have a wide range[.][LF]
of knowledge, don't you think?[A][LF]
When I was a journeyman, I lost[.][LF]
a lot of money to scams like this.[A][LF]
I started learning these tricks so[LF]
they couldn't be used on me anymore![A][LF]
It's all rubbish, innit? But it's not[.][LF]
a bad thing to add to your experience.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]I must hand it to you, you[LF]
have a point.[.][A][LF]
Some things, you can only[.][LF]
learn firsthand, on the field.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I've given away enough[LF]
of my secrets for one day.[A][LF]
I'll give you back all the money[LF]
I took you for, so go easy on me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Wait.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]There's no need to give it back.[A][LF]
That I failed to see your trick[.][LF]
was my own failing.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You serious?[A][LF]
All right. Good deal.[.][LF]
You're a good man.[A][LF]
Let's just call this[LF]
your tuition fee, eh?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Wait.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Now what? What is it this time?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]We're still in the middle of the bet.[.][A][LF]
We'll pick up where we left off.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you saying[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
you want to keep going?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Naturally.[A][LF]
You've revealed your secrets to[.][LF]
me. My luck is bound to change.[.][A][LF]
I feel a winning streak coming on.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Oh, brother.[A][LF]
Well, you're persistent,[LF]
I'll give you that much.[A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft][......][CR]Tails, hm?[.....][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Oh, well. Luck's just not on[LF]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][FID_0x22]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, may I ask what you are doing?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm? Oh, I was just checking my luck.[A][LF]
Looks like today is not set to be[.][LF]
one of my better ones.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]That's not good![A][LF]
Perhaps if you gave up that coin[LF]
for some good, honest prayer[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I have no need of luck, you see,[LF]
for I benefit from divine grace![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That sounds nice. I'd love to[.][LF]
have a bit of that myself.[A][LF]
All right, let's have a quick[.][LF]
bet to see which is better.[.][A][LF]
We'll test your divine grace[LF]
against my good old luck.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I could never give in to such[.][LF]
a vile sin.[.][A][LF]
Gambling is a pox, a boil upon[LF]
the fair skin of mankind.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's going a bit far,[.][LF]
don't you think?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Gambling corrupts the masses,[.][LF]
and I'll have none of it.[.][A][LF]
Which is the more noble: to earn[LF]
your keep or to swindle it?[.][A][LF]
And besides, this is a battlefield,[.][LF]
not a gambling hall.[A][LF]
No, I simply will not indulge in[LF]
such spiritual pollution here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, you're really making too[LF]
much of a big deal out of it.[.][A][LF]
This is just a coin toss. You can[.][LF]
flip a coin just about anywhere.[A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Let's see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CR][LF]

[OpenMidRight]Since you refuse to resist[LF]
the evils of temptation[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I shall have to teach you a[.][LF]
lesson you won't soon forget.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I knew you'd come around![.][LF]
Right, so let's see here[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Hey! It's heads![LF]
You really are lucky![.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh? I won?[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Well, of course I won! I shouldn't[LF]
be so surprised. It was fate.[.][A][LF]
One as blessed as I could never lose[LF]
at something so base as gambling.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Great, so let's keep going.[.][A][LF]
How about putting some money[LF]
down this time? 100 gold coins?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]That's fine.[A][LF]
Anything I win will, of course,[.][LF]
fund only noble causes.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's my girl[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]

[OpenMidRight]Hello, Joshua.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you have a few minutes to spare?[.][LF]
I wanted to win back my money.[A][LF]
You were doing pretty well the[LF]
other day. I was overconfident.[.][A][LF]
But today, I'm feeling lucky.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]I accept your proposal.[.][A][LF]
But remember, I think that gambling[.][LF]
is an immoral, inexcusable pastime.[.][A][LF]
You can tell it is wicked, because[LF]
of how good you feel when you win.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Can't disagree with you there.[A][LF]
Last time, I went easy on you[.][LF]
because you were an amateur.[A][LF]
Don't think I'm gonna throw[.][LF]
away my money like that today.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I would never ask you to go easy[LF]
on me, Joshua.[A][LF]
After all, I have righteousness at[LF]
my side, and I need no favors.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Righteousness? Is that[LF]
what you've got?[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]And to think, you were the one[LF]
telling me gambling was wrong![A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, but it is wrong. I meant to teach you[.][LF]
a lesson, and your lesson continues.[A][LF]

STILL managed to beat me![.][A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean, I don't know[LF]
anything? Oh! Such disrespect![A][LF]
What do you know, other than[LF]
gambling? Tell me that![.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm? Let's see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]I know how to survive in[LF]
a desert, for one thing.[A][ToggleSmile]

If that's all you've got, don't go[LF]
around telling me I'M the ignorant one![.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Aaaah! Enough already! Fine! Fine![LF]
I was wrong!!![A][LF]

gambling with you ANYMORE![A]

Who will I play with now?[.][A][CR][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Oh, I have an idea![.][A][LF]

a while, way back when.[.][A][LF]
But when two swordsmen met on the[.][LF]
battlefield--even allied swordsmen--[A][LF]
they would duel it out to test one[LF]
another's worth with the blade.[.][A][LF]
So what do you say? Don't you think[.][LF]
it's time to revive this tradition?[.][A][ToggleSmile]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Er[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Great! Now, what say we[LF]
make this more interesting?[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa! Hold your horses! Where's the[.][LF]
hurry? Let's do this another day.[.][A][LF]

but fine.[.][A]

Next time we meet, we[.][LF]
cross swords. Deal?[.][A][ToggleSmile]

Renais didn't fall because of bad[.][LF]

bad, but it's no excuse for failure.[A][ToggleSmile]

[OpenMidLeft]No, I'm fine, but I'm worried[.][LF]
about my pegasus[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Here, let me take a look.[.][A][LF]
Hm. Looks like he's got a wound here[LF]
that hasn't properly healed.[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]I can fix this up for you.[A][LF]
It's nothing serious, but you might want[LF]
to get him some proper care later.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Thanks, Kyle. You're a lifesaver.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]It was careless of me not to[LF]
have noticed the injury.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Your pegasus is smart. He may have hidden[.][LF]
it from you so as not to worry you.[.][A][LF]
It's not your fault, Syrene. You[LF]
shouldn't worry about it.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I'm just not fit to be a pegasus[LF]
knight. I'm so pitiful.[.][A][LF]
If you hadn't seen that injury, I could[.][LF]
have put us both in danger.[.][A][LF]
I could have cost us both our lives.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]You're being too hard on yourself.[A][LF]
If you were in danger, I would have[.][LF]
been at your side in an instant.[A][LF]
I'm sure you would do the same,[.][LF]
wouldn't you?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Yes, gladly.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We just have to help one another[LF]
out if something happens.[.][A][LF]
You and I have been friends for[.][LF]
over ten years, after all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]For over ten years?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]That's right, Syrene. You did[.][LF]
the same for me back then.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Back then?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]It was on the day I left Frelia.[A][LF]
Near the border, I came upon some[.][LF]
bandits harassing a poor merchant.[A][LF]
I tried to help him, but I was[LF]
outnumbered. Badly.[.][A][LF]
When they saw I was a knight, they[LF]
wasted no time surrounding me.[A][LF]
I thought that was it for me, but[.][LF]
then, out of nowhere, you show up.[A][LF]
You and I drove off those bandits,[LF]
and you saved my life that day.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see you've finished your homework.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, so that's what you wanted me to[.][LF]
remember! “Don't be a hero” indeed![.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]You'd left Frelia before I could give[.][LF]
you a going-away present.[.][A][LF]
I went out, hoping to catch up to you,[LF]
when I saw you surrounded by bandits.[.][A][LF]
You were fighting all those bandits[.][LF]
on your own to save that merchant[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I'd never seen a knight so dedicated[LF]
to the protection of the innocent.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Going-away present[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] You're[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The wooden pegasus I carved for you![LF]
[ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]You still have it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course I do! After we dealt with[.][LF]
those bandits, you said to me,[A][LF]
“Keep this, and remember Frelia.”[.][A][LF]
How could I possibly misplace it?[.][LF]
I carry it with me as a reminder.[.][A][LF]
As long as I have this, I feel like I'll[LF]
always have someone watching over me.[.][A][LF]
Actually, I started collecting wooden[.][LF]
figurines since you gave me this.[.][A][LF]
But I always carry this one on me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm glad to hear it's[.][LF]
meant so much to you.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]I'll treasure it always.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][.....][LF]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Kyle[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
When we're all at peace again,[LF]
won't you visit Frelia once more?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]You know[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....][LF]
I was thinking about that, too.[.][A][LF]
I think I really missed out by[LF]
not having Frelian seafood.[.][A][LF]
This time around, I won't miss it.[LF]
And I should see some sights, too.[A][LF]
Will you show me around, Syrene?[A]

I can fry up a mean fish, too![A][X]

I'm so glad we talked the other[.][LF]

[OpenMidRight]I did, too, my lady. I was[LF]

The young Princess Tana I once[LF]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Y-you think so? Tell me,[LF]
how have I changed?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]You're so serious now. This war[.][LF]

You're not the same princess[LF]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I know that I've lived a sheltered[LF]

Your strength and pride[.][LF]

Your example is a lesson that[.][LF]

You truly are a kind lady.[A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Thank you! When I return home to[LF]

I hope to cook my parents a proper[LF]
meal to apologize for running off.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sure they'll be surprised to see[LF]
how much you've grown out here.[.][A][LF]

That still sounds so odd to me. You know,[.][LF]

But please, just call me Cormag. There's[LF]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Cormag it is, then. I had[.][LF]

[OpenMidRight]What would you have me do, Princess?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm prone to attacks from archers[.][LF]
when I'm on the battlefield[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]That makes two of us.[.][A][LF]
It's a common problem for[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I thought perhaps we could keep watch[.][LF]
for archers and warn one another.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Hm. Yes, you've got a good idea[.][LF]
there. A “buddy system” of sorts.[.][A][LF]
But if you saw an ally in danger, you'd[.][LF]
warn him regardless, wouldn't you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, of course! But we're so high[LF]
up that I was worried[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
If I saw an archer, I didn't think[LF]
my voice would carry to you in time.[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Perhaps the neighing of a pegasus or[LF]
the cries of a wyvern could carry[.][A][LF]
far enough to warn the others.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Oh! I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Yes, we might not be able[LF]
to hear each other in the heat of battle.[.][A][LF]
But our steeds can be louder than[.][LF]
either of us could.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're no traitor, Cormag. You've[.][LF]

I'm still your brother, and I think[.][LF]
I know you better than anyone else.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Do you mean that, Innes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Absolutely.[.][A][LF]
Do you remember the incident[LF]
with the crown?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....][LF]
Oh![.][A][CR][LF]
I remember. It was when I was very[LF]
little, and I lost Father's crown.[A][LF]
He was so angry with me. I thought[LF]
he would never stop yelling.[A][LF]
I was so terrified of his wrath, and[LF]
I just couldn't stop crying.[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]I honestly believed Father would[LF]
throw me in the dungeon![A][LF]
But you searched the castle from top[LF]
to bottom, and you found the crown.[.][A][LF]
And I remember what you told Father[.][LF]
when you brought it back to him:[A][LF]
“I took your crown, Father. I wanted to[.][LF]
see what it would look like on my head.”[A][LF]
I remember how happy I was when I heard[.][LF]
Father laughing at your words.[A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Marisa, is it difficult to[LF]

[OpenMidRight]It is.[A][LF]
I practice daily. I've fought a[.][LF]

And still, I have seen only the barest[LF]
glimpse of what I could achieve.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]

[OpenMidRight]It's not a matter of whether[LF]
you should or should not.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]At first, I thought you were brusque[LF]
and[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]maybe a little intimidating, too.[.][A][LF]
But you're not like that at all. You're[.][LF]
just shy--and a poor conversationalist.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]A poor--[.....] You know, many of my[.][LF]
fellow swordsmen still fear me.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sure they do. Your grace with[.][LF]
the sword is something else.[A][LF]
But when you're not fighting, you're[LF]
completely different. More pensive.[.][A][LF]
You're so dedicated to your goal. You[.][LF]
have that far-off look in your eyes,[A][LF]
like you're lost in thoughts of love[LF]
or something like that.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]You've already made up your mind, Princess,[.][LF]
so there's no point in my arguing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then we agree! Oh, but there's[LF]
one more thing.[.][A][LF]
Just call me Tana. You don't have[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]We're friends now.[A][ToggleSmile]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's right! So just call me Tana.[.][A][LF]

I'm sorry you had to see[LF]
that ugly side of me.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh? What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]At Renvall, when you stayed by me.[A][LF]
If not for your loyalty, I would have fallen[LF]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, well, that's my job, innit?[.][A][LF]
But what's your point? This[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]I've guided men into battle countless[.][LF]
times before that day.[A][LF]
I've always tried to be a model commander,[LF]

[OpenMidLeft]But you're different. I've known[LF]

How do you stay so composed in[LF]
the heat of battle?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't know how to answer that[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I suppose it's just in my nature.[.][A][CR][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Nice work, Gerik[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I see the Desert Tiger is[.][LF]
still as fierce as ever.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I can't believe my skill with the blade[.][LF]
is known in circles as high as yours.[.][A][LF]
Let me tell you, I didn't get into this[.][LF]
line of work because I like fighting.[.][A][LF]
It was a twist of fate that started[.][LF]
me on this path[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Really? But I've heard of your fame[.][LF]
from no less a person than my father.[.][A][LF]
He tells me your name was once known[LF]
from shore to shore on this continent.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The past is the past. I was just[LF]
doing what I had to.[A][LF]
If I hadn't, I never would have[.][LF]
survived.[.][A][LF]
But there's something about combat[LF]
that just doesn't agree with my nature.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]If that's the case, why are[.][LF]
you with these mercenaries?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ahh[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]The answer is so simple,[LF]
you'll probably laugh.[A][LF]
Back when I was a kid, a friend from my[.][LF]
village said he wanted to be a mercenary.[.][A][LF]
He said he was going to be famous, the[LF]
greatest warrior in all the land.[.][A][LF]
No matter how many times I told him to[LF]
give it up, he wouldn't listen to me.[.][A][LF]
Well, one day, he left for Jehanna.[.][A][LF]
I didn't know what else to do, so I went[LF]
with him and joined the guild, too.[.][A][LF]
Stupid reason, isn't it? Anyway[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I didn't particularly like fighting, and[LF]
while I wasn't opposed to the money,[A][LF]
I certainly wasn't in it for fame[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I just couldn't let my friend go off[LF]
and get killed.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]And where is this friend now?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]He went off and got killed.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So there was no reason for me to[LF]
continue being a mercenary[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
But then there were other men who I[.][LF]
considered to be my friends.[A][LF]
I couldn't bring myself to abandon them[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
And so the years passed and here I am.[A][LF]
The thing is I can't stand to see my [.][LF]
friends die.[A][LF]
But if you're in this business long enough,[.][LF]
people around you get killed. It happens.[.][A][LF]
The only thing you can do is keep moving[LF]
forward and try not to think about it.[A][LF]
So[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Yes, I'd have a problem if you[LF]
got yourself killed.[A][LF]
I've got no place else to go, and I'm tired [LF]
of trying to forget.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmph[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
Do you really think I'd lose so easily?[.][A][LF]
It won't do for you to underestimate me.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Eh?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]There's something I've always assumed[.][LF]

Those born to royalty cannot show[.][LF]
others any weaknesses or deficiencies.[A][LF]
If they're not perfect at all times, their[LF]
enemies will take advantage of them.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah? So?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]But meeting you has made me rethink[.][LF]
that belief.[A][LF]
My father told me before I left that[LF]
I should watch you and learn from you.[A][LF]
At the time, I believed there was[.][LF]
nothing a mercenary could teach me.[.][A][LF]
Now I know better. I am thankful to both[LF]
my father and you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's enough of that. In my opinion,[.][LF]
you're much finer than I could ever be.[.][A][LF]
The way you live, your manners, and your[LF]
bearing[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] I could never pull it off.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Me? What do you mean?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Look at you! You're full of confidence.[.][LF]
You've got pride.[.][A][LF]
When I first met you, I thought,[LF]
“What a high-handed dandy.” [A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you just call me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]a dandy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But that's just who you are.[A][LF]
Being proud is not always[.][LF]
a bad thing.[A][LF]
You must have worked yourself near to[.][LF]
death to preserve that pride.[.][A][LF]
What I mean is that you never make[LF]
excuses for losing or being beaten up.[A][LF]
No matter the pain you face or hardship, [.][LF]
you keep on fighting to honor that pride.[.][A][LF]
It's what defines you, and I can't[LF]
say that I don't admire it.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]It comes naturally.[.][A][LF]
I will be king one day, and I will make[.][LF]
Frelia the greatest nation in all the world.[A][LF]
It will be a wonderful kingdom of wealth [.][LF]
and power.[A][LF]
When that day comes, I will command you[.][LF]
to become general and lead Frelia's armies.[.][A][LF]

make you general.[.][A][ToggleSmile]

I know not what fish your country[.][LF]

And yet[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]You mean to ask which is the[LF]

[OpenMidRight]What? That's no question at all![LF]
Rausten is clearly superior in every way.[.][A]

[OpenMidLeft]Of course. I agree completely.[A][LF]

Invitations to tour our two nations[.][LF]

Very well then. Let us deal with this[.][LF]

But I've been dancing so much[.][LF]
I've worked up quite a sweat.[.][A][LF]
At this rate I may even lose a few[LF]
inches off of my waistline.[.][A][LF]
Who knows, maybe my figure will be[LF]
even more alluring than before.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Ha ha ha! Well, I'm not sure that's even[LF]
possible, but keep up the good work.[A][LF]
Your dancing has had quite a restorative [.][LF]
effect on the troops.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really? I'm happy to hear it. I[.][LF]
must keep dancing then, mustn't I?[A][CR][LF]
Oh, I almost forgot, Chief.[.][A][LF]
I have good news, and then I have[.][LF]
better news.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's the good news?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I hear today's meal is one of[.][LF]
your favorites, herbed stew.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, that is good news! It's been quite[LF]
a while since I've had any.[.][A][LF]
And the even better news?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]In this next battle, you'll get your hands[LF]
on some sort of an incredible treasure.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]A treasure?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, that's right, some sort of treasure.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Ha ha ha! I see. I don't know what it[.][LF]
might be, but I can't wait for it.[A][LF]
Nor for today's meal.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm going to continue dancing a bit longer[LF]
so as to work up a healthy appetite.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So tell me, Tethys, when did[LF]
you first start dancing?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
Well, that would have been[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Hm?[.][......][LF]
What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Um, well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Yes, it was long ago.[.][LF]
Back when Ewan was still young.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]What is it, Tethys?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry, Chief. I'll explain  it [.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Chief.[A][LF]
The truth is, Ewan and I? We were[.][LF]
abandoned by our parents.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....][LF]
Oh, I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I wandered about with little Ewan in tow.[.][LF]
He had no idea what was happening.[A][LF]
I was a child myself with no job.[.][A][LF]
We went to bed hungry every night,[LF]
and our clothes were rags[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then one day I said to myself,[LF]
“We cannot go on like this!”[A][LF]
I watched a dancer on a street corner[.][LF]
and memorized all of her moves.[.][A][LF]
I wasn't a very coordinated child and[.][LF]
it was so difficult.[A][LF]
I didn't have real shoes, so my feet[LF]
were a mess of blisters,[A][LF]
and I fell so many times I was covered[LF]
in cuts and bruises.[A][LF]
It was painful. And miserable. And[LF]
very, very difficult. But I never cried.[A][LF]
Because if were to cry, he would cry.[.][LF]
And I loved seeing Ewan's smiling face.[.][A][LF]
I wanted him to smile all the time,[.][LF]
so I worked hard so he could.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Tethys[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Tee hee hee. What a sad and[.][LF]
miserable tale. I'm sorry.[A][LF]
I was reminded of it all just recently,[.][LF]
and I was overcome with emotion[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
But that's how I earned the dancing skills[LF]
and physique I have now![A][LF]
All of the hard work I did back then [.][LF]
has made me the woman I am today.[.][A][ToggleSmile]

So before you met up with us, the two of you[LF]
had a rough time of it, did you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]OK, that's enough. The past is the past![LF]
You mustn't tell anyone about this.[.][A][LF]
I don't share this story with others.[.][LF]
I only told you because you're the chief.[.][A][LF]
A story of toil and hardship doesn't quite [.][LF]
fit my mysterious image, does it?[.][A][CR][LF]
You know what I'd like?[.][.....][LF]
For you to tell me more about you.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Sure. Another time, though, OK?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right. Let's see this[.][LF]
thing through to the end.[.][A][LF]
If we do our best, good things will come[LF]
of it. And then better things after that.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][FID_0x1C]
[OpenMidRight]Um, Chief, there's actually one[.][LF]
thing I've been wanting to ask you.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]And what's that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sorry if this brings up any bad memories, but[.][LF]
how'd you get that scar on your face?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]This?[.][A][LF]
I got this beauty when I had[LF]
just started out as a mercenary.[A][CR][LF]
I was still a novice, but I was feeling[.][LF]
pretty good about my swordsmanship.[.][A][LF]
I got to a point where I was arrogant[.][LF]
enough to believe no one could best me.[.][A][LF]
Then one day it happened[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It's something[LF]
I've never been able to forget.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]What happened?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It was just another battle. I'd been hired[LF]
on as another sword and then I met him.[.][A][LF]
He was a knight from some country[.][LF]
or another.[.][A][LF]
I had fought knights on several other[.][LF]
occasions and had beaten them all.[A][LF]
Even though he was a bit tougher,[.][LF]
I was sure I'd defeat him in the end.[.][A][LF]
That's what I thought.[A][LF]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CR][LF]
His strength was beyond me. I may as well [LF]
have been using a broomstick to fight.[A][LF]
I remember thinking, “What a tiny little[LF]
world I've been living in.”[.][A][LF]
He crushed me effortlessly, and the wound[.][LF]
he inflicted became this lovely scar.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I was truly frightened. It was the first[LF]
time I'd experienced fear as a mercenary.[.][A][LF]
So this knight saw how scared I was[.][LF]
and said, “Go.”[.][A][LF]
He didn't kill me.[LF]
He let me escape.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I was humiliated and ashamed.[.][A][LF]
My eyes were finally opened to [.][LF]
my own weakness.[A][LF]
It goes without saying I lost every[.][LF]
shred of self-confidence.[.][A][CR][LF]
[.....]I still dream about it sometimes.[.][LF]
It wakes me up every time.[A][LF]
I've never forgotten that knight.[.][LF]
He thought I was weak and pathetic.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Chief[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I was young and stupid.[.][LF]
This scar is my punishment.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]But that knight[.][LF]
spared your life.[.][A][LF]
Because of that, good things and[LF]
better things have happened?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you mean, Tethys?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]First of all, Chief, you're alive.[A][LF]
If you had died, all the good times[.][LF]
you've had since that day,[A][LF]
and all the joy you're sure to have[.][LF]
from this day onward, wouldn't exist.[.][A][LF]
And another thing, because you lived, you[.][LF]
made many friends and you met me.[.][A][LF]
I also don't think that knight thought[LF]
you were pathetic.[A][LF]
I think he saw a young man with his whole[.][LF]
life ahead of him.[A][LF]
That's why he let you go.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Tethys[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Yep. [.][.....]I'm sure that's it. So try[LF]
thinking about it in a more positive light.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha. [....]You're right.[.][LF]
I was a lot calmer after that.[A][LF]
And while I've had hard times,[LF]
there've been far more good times.[A][LF]
I guess you could say I owe my success[LF]
as a mercenary to that knight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yep.[LF]
You've got your knight,[.][A][LF]
and I've got my dancer. Thanks to the[.][LF]
two of them, the two of us are here now.[A][LF]
Say, Chief, why don't we become like them?[A][LF]
I think we should work at being[.][LF]
inspirations to other people.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]good idea.[A][CR][LF]
Thanks, Tethys.[.][LF]
I think I'll sleep soundly tonight.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Good.[.][.....][LF]
You know, Chief, I'm really happy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, me, too. I've got a life I enjoy [.][LF]
and good companions.[A][LF]
All that and a wonderful woman to love.[.][LF]

The elder's eyes[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]they were not the[.][LF]

I know I'm being rude, but[LF]
I've a favor to ask.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What is it?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Would you please come[.][LF]
to our village?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]To Caer Pelyn?[A][LF]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dara and the other villagers[LF]
would be overjoyed to see you.[A][LF]
The village is quite spare, but we[LF]
would do our best to entertain you.[.][A][LF]
You could stay for as long as you[.][LF]
wanted[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Saleh, you made that request[LF]
on my behalf, didn't you?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, not at all.[.][A][LF]
I apologize. I have[.][LF]
been disrespectful.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I'm pleased.[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]However[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I doubt I should[LF]
stay too long.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why is that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's because I'm a dragon.[A][LF]
My father explained it to me.[.][A][LF]
We are both human and monster.[A][LF]
And because we are both, we[.][LF]
are also neither.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]We have the power of dragons; therefore,[LF]
we cannot live together with humans[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
We have the hearts of humans; therefore,[LF]
we do not belong with monsters.[.][A][LF]
We are outcasts in this world, never[LF]
a part of either community.[.][A][LF]
And so we live our lives alone, never[.][LF]
to be understood by anyone.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]But there are humans whose actions make[.][LF]
them monsters in the eyes of others.[A][LF]
I do not think of you as such when there are[LF]
many worse monsters among my own kind.[A][LF]
Regardless, I believe the villagers would[.][LF]
be most pleased to have you visit.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Saleh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Thank you. Your words have cheered[LF]
me up a little.[.][A][LF]
Please wait for my answer. When all[.][LF]
of this is finished[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
When peace returns, I'll give you[.][LF]
my answer then.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]I understand.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]And when I do return to Darkling[LF]
Woods, I will not be sad.[.][A][LF]
Because of the time I've spent with[.][LF]

I shall not be lonely. I shall[LF]
never feel like an outcast again.[.][A][ToggleSmile]

Oh, Ewan![.][A]

[ToggleSmile]“To know the harmony of heaven and earth,[.][LF]
body and spirit”[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]right?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, you are correct.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]“To contemplate oneself”[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
And[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]what was the rest?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]“To contemplate the world and to envision[.][LF]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, that's right.[.][A][LF]
Doesn't it get to be a bother finding[.][LF]
a quiet place like this, though?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Contemplation takes time, Ewan. It doesn't[LF]
matter where, so long as you do it.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Well, if Valega is an important part of[.][LF]
Caer Pelyn's culture and history,[.][A][LF]
I think I might give it a try.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Really? And I wonder how many[.][LF]
days you'll last at that.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Heh. I guess you're right. Knowing the[LF]
harmony of the heavens sounds tough.[A][LF]
Do you have anything easier I could[.][LF]
practice in the meantime?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm. Let me think. Your skill level[LF]
is still quite low, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks, Teacher.[A][LF]
I remember when you first decided[.][LF]
to teach me some magic.[.][A][LF]
I was so excited that I went out[LF]
and practiced over and over again.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]You must pace yourself. Using too much[LF]
magic can drain both body and soul.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah. Boy, I know that.[.][A][LF]
After that time, I was so tired[.][LF]
that I couldn't stay awake.[.][A][LF]
I was so tired that I slept for[.][LF]
a full day. I woke up in bed[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Technically, it was two days.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, so that was you who[.][LF]
carried me home?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Mm-hm.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Now that I think about it, no one[.][LF]
else would have bothered! Thank you.[A][ToggleSmile]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Teacher.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]What is it, Ewan?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you remember a few years ago when[LF]
you went to visit Commander Gerik?[A][LF]
That was when I met you and followed[LF]
you back to Caer Pelyn.[.][A][LF]
I never said thank you for taking me[LF]
in, Teacher. I've never regretted it.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]I remember it clearly. I kept thinking,[.][LF]
“What have I gotten myself into?”[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]If that's the way you felt about it,[LF]
why did you let me be your student?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your eyes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]My eyes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You had a spark in your eyes.[.][A][LF]
I knew that I saw an exceptional[LF]
talent for magic in those eyes.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wow. That's really something.[.][LF]
I would never have guessed.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sure, as your training progresses,[LF]
that you will feel your power grow.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'll train even harder, then![.][A][LF]
Back when I first started, I[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
thought you were kinda scary.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Me?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, you don't really talk much.[.][A][LF]
I always thought you were angry[.][LF]
with me, and I didn't know why.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]All that because I was so silent[LF]
all the time?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yep. But after a while, I figured[.][LF]
out it was just the way you were.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Ewan, you can never find truth in[.][LF]
words, spoken or unspoken.[A][LF]
Truth lives within the heart.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]But other people can't see what's[.][LF]
inside your heart, can they?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you can trust one another, you[.][LF]
can see. And you will understand.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh! Is that how it works?[.][LF]
[ToggleSmile]I think I get it now.[.][A][LF]
But talking is so important in[LF]
building friendships, isn't it?[.][A][LF]
We use words to communicate things[LF]
like feelings and ideas.[A][LF]
But all that stuff, it's just on[LF]
the surface. Does that mean that[A][LF]
if people use their hearts, they[LF]
can communicate without using words?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]That's right.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You really are great, Teacher.[A][LF]
You teach me by making me teach myself,[.][LF]
and I mean more than just magic[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Remember how angry you were at[LF]
me that one time?[.][A][LF]
Back when I took out that magic tome?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I wasn't angry that you[.][LF]
took the tome out with you.[.][A][LF]
It's that you took it with you[LF]
without asking and went for a stroll.[.][A][LF]
And then you stopped to[.][LF]
play in the river[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's right. Then I dropped it and[.][LF]
SPLASH!! Right in it went[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
It wasn't in the water long, but those[LF]
pages were totally illegible[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]That utter carelessness[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][LF]
No, your lack of consideration.[.][A][LF]
That's what made me angry.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm s-sorry.[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]But I never took any books with[.][LF]
me when I went to the river after that.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]And there were other things, as well.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, you don't mean[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]that?[.][LF]

I don't have any problems.[A][LF]
I was thinking of something interesting.[LF]
You want to hear about it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sure. Tell me everything.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I was thinking of how much fun it[.][LF]
would be if I could do something[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh-huh.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Some battlegrounds are full of plants and[.][LF]

[OpenMidRight]Yeah.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]If a place like that were suddenly filled[.][LF]

Like if it could suddenly become[LF]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ho ho, a battleground becoming a[LF]
lovely flower garden?[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Aye, that would be nice. It would help[LF]

But how would you do it? Do you have some[.][LF]
sort of magical powers or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, I do, but I've decided that[.][LF]
wouldn't be the best way.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidRight]Uh-huh.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]And we've got a coach in our convoy[.][LF]

[OpenMidRight]Yeah, they're useful enough.[A][LF]
They're nice if you're traveling far with [LF]
wounded men, children, and whatnot.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]But without roads, they're almost useless,[LF]
and forget about dense forests.[.][A][LF]
Oh, and they can be quite vulnerable in[.][LF]
a battle. Not very useful at all, really.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Exactly! So I was thinking about coaches[LF]
that could travel in the air[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's that?[A][CR][LF]
Are you talking about using[.][LF]
pegasus knights?[A][ToggleSmile]

But wouldn't it be amazing if one[.][LF]
really existed?[.][A][LF]
It would be fast, and all that stuff like[.][LF]
bad roads and forests wouldn't matter![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ho ho ho ho![A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]And even if people lived far apart, they[LF]
could visit one another quickly![A][LF]
What do you think?[A]

[OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha! It's fantastic! And it[LF]
would be useful, that's for sure![.][A][LF]

[OpenMidRight]Hm?! What is it? What's[.][LF]
happened, Princess L'Arachel?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hello, Dozla.[.][LF]
Listen to this.[.][A][LF]
The other day, I paid a visit[.][LF]
to a nearby village.[A][LF]
I found something inconceivable there.[A][LF]
Not one of them had ever heard of the[.][LF]

[OpenMidRight]What?![A][LF]

This will never do, Dozla.[A][LF]
I must be more famous. The entire[.][LF]
world must know of my legend.[.][A][LF]
The troubadours must be made to[.][LF]
sing my praises far and wide.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]And I'm sure they will![.][A]

And you shall be, Princess![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]But I get the feeling that we're going[LF]
to have to change our methodology.[A][LF]
Appealing to the common people is of[LF]

First and foremost, we need a plan of[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, Dozla! What a splendid idea![A][LF]

It wouldn't do for me to ride about[.][LF]
calling myself by my own nickname.[A][LF]
It must be spread about in a[LF]
nonchalant manner.[A][LF]
Dozla, starting now, I want you to refer[LF]
to me exclusively by my epithet,[A][LF]
“L'Arachel, the beautiful princess of peerless[LF]
beauty,” when you're among the soldiers.[A][LF]
And don't forget to slip it into[LF]

How is it that no one has[.][LF]

[OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha![.][LF]
How right you are![A][LF]
But you are peerless, Princess L'Arachel,[.][LF]

It would be impossible for anyone to[LF]
claim your beauty as her own![.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, that is true. It certainly was[LF]
not easy for me, after all.[.][A][CR][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Yet now, I am destined to be[LF]

I am so looking forward to it.[A][LF]
“The beautiful princess of peerless[.][LF]

You may be a fair dancer, but your[LF]
smooth moves belie your gruff manners.[A][LF]
You should learn from me. If you were[.][LF]
truly happy, you would not sigh so.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Gold, did you say?[A][LF]
So if you had gold, you would[.][LF]

[OpenMidRight]Well, if you have enough gold, you[LF]
can buy whatever you desire.[A][LF]
Mercenaries work so that they can[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]So, by getting what you desire,[.][LF]
you can be happy? Is that it?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Rather than lament over what you do not[.][LF]
possess, you should treasure what you do.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Hm, you think so? Merely holding this[.][LF]
lance makes me tremble with dread.[A][LF]
Not overly so, but enough to stop[.][LF]
me from wielding it in combat.[A][LF]
This lance[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It can drive its[LF]
wielder to madness.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Madness, you say?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, Cormag. It's a magic weapon of dark[LF]
design that's been in my family for ages.[.][A][LF]
Legend states that the leader of our house[LF]
must always carry it, but never use it.[.][A][LF]
We are prohibited from wielding it until such[.][LF]
a time as madness itself rules the day.[.][A][LF]
It's part of my legacy, and yet[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
I made a grave error[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I allowed Valter to use this lance.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]You let Valter[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]We were in the middle of a battle.[A][LF]
Valter had broken his lance, and when I[.][LF]
wasn't looking he somehow took this one.[A][LF]
From that moment, he was changed[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
He killed everyone[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]even retreating men.[A][LF]
I took the lance from him when I realized[.][LF]
what had happened, but it was too late.[.][A][LF]
Madness had awakened within Valter and[LF]
was coursing through his body.[A][LF]
From then on, he hungered only for battle[.][LF]
and for blood[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
It's not as though Valter was a gentle lamb[.][LF]
before, but now his appetite for violence[.][A][LF]
increased many times over. It's all[.][LF]
because of this cursed lance.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
That odd light playing around the point[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
I thought it looked familiar.[.][A][LF]
It was Valter[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It's the same light Valter[LF]
had in his eyes on the battlefield.[.][A][LF]
Valter's insane because of this lance.[LF]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Sir Duessel, if it please you, would you[LF]
let me have this lance?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidLeft]What? You?[LF]
B-but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you worried that I will[.][LF]
end up like Valter?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]N-no[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]This lance[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]someone needs to master it.[.][LF]
It's just a feeling I have.[.][A][LF]
A weapon is only as good or evil as[.][LF]
the man who wields it.[A][LF]
In the hands of someone just, it can[LF]
be a righteous weapon.[A][LF]
In the hands of the wicked, it's a[LF]
danger to all.[A][LF]
Believe me, I have not been seduced[.][LF]
by this lance.[A][LF]
I merely want to see it used for the[LF]
purpose for which it was forged.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I understand you, Cormag.[.][LF]
I'm going to let you have it.[.][A][LF]
I have no son. I had not yet decided[LF]
to whom I should pass on this legacy.[.][A][LF]
Now I see that leaving it to someone[LF]
whom I trust and believe in is best.[A][LF]
As with me, your admiration of weapons[LF]
is balanced by a healthy respect.[.][A][LF]
You also have a good eye, and you[.][LF]
possess tremendous strength.[A][LF]
The day you are able to wield this lance[LF]
may not be far off at all.[A][LF]
If the madness in this lance can be tamed,[LF]
it may very well be a weapon without equal.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I never had the courage to wield it, but[LF]
I would love to see it used righteously.[A][LF]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I am entrusting it to you.[LF]
I hope you will use it one day.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]I accept your gift, Sir Duessel.[A][CR][LF]
I would receive it once this battle is[LF]
finished and our hearts are calmer.[.][A][LF]
If I were to take it in the heat of[.][LF]
battle, I might become Valter the second.[.][A][LF]
It is a possibility that I cannot dismiss.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I see.[.][LF]
Cormag[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'm counting on you.[A][LF]
I look forward to the day I can see[.][LF]
this lance wielded correctly.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Understood.[.][A][LF]
Until that time comes, please try not to[LF]
get yourself killed, [.][ToggleSmile]General Duessel![A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ha![.][A][ToggleSmile][X]

We've all been struggling so hard,[LF]

General Duessel?[A][LF]
Is something wrong?[.][A]

Your[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
From the first time I laid eyes[.][LF]
upon you, your face[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I was sure I'd seen it before[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh? Is that so?[A][LF]
You mean before now? Or before[LF]
I even joined Grado's army?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, that's right, but I can't recall[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
Getting to be my age has its price.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't be silly![.][A][LF]
I happen to think you're still[LF]
quite young, General Duessel![.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, now you've got my attention! What[.][LF]
was it you wanted this old soldier for?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]It's just that, even among the younger[LF]
knights, there's no match for you.[A][LF]
And, uh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ha ha! I'm not so old that you need to[LF]
worry about propping up my ego, lass.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....][A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
[OpenEyes]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sure I'm not the only one in[LF]
this army who feels that way, either.[.][A][LF]
The fighting's fierce, Amelia.[LF]
You watch yourself![.][A][LF]
When you're near me, I'll make sure[.][LF]
I keep a good eye out for you, too.[.][A][LF]
I'll be there in a flash if you need[LF]
me. Go ahead and fight without worry.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, y-yes, sir![.][LF]
Thank you very much.[A][LF]
Fighting alongside you, General[.][LF]
Duessel, is a great honor.[A][LF]

[OpenMidRight]Amelia.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]General Duessel.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It seems like you've grown quite[LF]
comfortable with the spear.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir! I have, sir.[LF]
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You did well to choose the spear as[.][LF]
your weapon. It suits your height well.[.][A][LF]
It also extends your reach and[LF]
enables you to strike with force.[.][A][LF]
More force, even, than a sword[LF]
could bring to bear in a battle.[A][LF]
All weapons have their own[LF]
unique characteristics.[.][A][LF]
You're familiar with the idea that some[.][LF]
weapons are strong against others?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Isn't that what they call[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
the weapon triangle?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, it is. And from the looks of things,[.][LF]
your affinity for the spear is quite good.[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]If you continue to practice, you should[.][LF]
continue to improve and grow stronger.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[.][.....][LF]
Ah, that makes me happy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Mm. To begin with, the spear[LF]
is quite a deep weapon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Yet the attacks comprise three[LF]
surprisingly simple movements.[A][LF]
Right step, left step, and thrust.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Right step, left step, and thrust[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
I'm following you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Excellent.[LF]
But listen, Amelia.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidLeft]Y-yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Because they are so simple, they are[LF]
easy to learn but tough to perfect.[.][A][LF]
They are the strongest and most[.][LF]
pure of techniques.[.][A][LF]
When you practice them, practice[LF]
perfecting each gesture.[A][LF]
And remember, the spear is a subtle[.][LF]
and powerful weapon.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir![.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Now it goes without saying that other[.][LF]
weapons have their good points, too.[A][LF]
Swords are easy-to-use, all-purpose weapons,[LF]
and axes possess devastating strength.[A][LF]
You should learn to use each weapon type.[.][A][LF]
If you can master them all, you'll be[.][LF]
an unstoppable force.[.][A][LF]
That is, of course, if you can overcome[.][LF]
your own natural affinities.[A][LF]
To begin with, you should work on[.][LF]
mastering one weapon type.[A][LF]
Then you can gradually change weapons[.][LF]
until you can use them all.[.][A][LF]
That's what I have done, you understand.[A][LF]
That's called being multi-proficient.[.][A][CR][LF]
[ToggleSmile]I'd like to tell you more about different[.][LF]
weapons, but that lecture must wait.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Wow[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
General Duessel, you know so much[.][LF]
about weapons, don't you?[.][A][LF]
I didn't even realize how caught[LF]
up I'd become. [.][ToggleSmile]All right![A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidRight]What is it? Where are[.][LF]
you rushing off to?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I want to practice the things[.][LF]
you've told me about.[.][A][LF]
The basics[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]right, left, thrust. Right?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Mm, that's correct.[.][LF]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I'm happy to see you so enthused, but[.][LF]
do you have any reason to rush so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Um, well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
There's someone[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]one of the Knights of[.][LF]
Renais[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]to whom I do not want to lose.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's not that we're going to fight, or[LF]
that I want to defeat him or anything[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
It's just that we're kind of keeping track[LF]
of the other's progress, and[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]It's just a thing we do.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]I see. I think that should prove to[.][LF]
be a good source of motivation then.[A][LF]
Get to it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, sir![.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I think I'll, um, go and[LF]
practice over there[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I'd be nervous in front of you, so[LF]
[ToggleSmile]I'm going to practice on my own.[A][LF]
I'll be back to show you later.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]All right. Understood.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Great! See you later![.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidRight]Ha ha[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Such energy. I feel energized[.][LF]
just being around her.[A][LF]
She's just a girl now, but someday[LF]

[OpenMidLeft]
[OpenEyes]
[OpenMidLeft]What!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It happened a few years back.[.][A][LF]
I was leading a patrol near[.][LF]
the Grado border.[.][A][LF]
We unexpectedly rode up on a group of[.][LF]
bandits, and a battle ensued.[.][A][LF]
When we had taken care of the bandits,[LF]
we rescued a lone female captive.[.][A][LF]
We figured she had been taken from some[.][LF]
village, but she was in shock.[A][LF]
In fact, her distress was so great, she[.][LF]
had forgotten much about herself.[.][A][LF]
Her body was in such a weakened[.][LF]
state that she could barely walk.[.][A][LF]
We felt such pity for her that we took[LF]
her to a peaceful village we knew of.[.][A][LF]
There, we set up a home for her where[.][LF]
she could recover and live quietly.[.][A][LF]
Some years later, she was restored[LF]
to her former vitality.[.][A][LF]
Slowly, she began to recall the lost[LF]
memories of her past.[.][A][LF]
Only recently did she remember that[.][LF]
she had once had a daughter.[A][LF]
I took time off from my duties and visited[LF]
the village where she had lived.[A][LF]
But the villagers told me her daughter[LF]
had left the village some time ago.[.][A][LF]
With no clues as to the girl's whereabouts,[.][LF]
I'd almost given up hope of finding her.[A][LF]
And then, in the strangest of places[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]
[OpenLeft]I-it can't be! Th-that woman[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
What is her name?[.][A]

[OpenLeft]What!?[......][LF]
Are you[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Are you sure?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I am. I see Melina's[.][LF]
face reflected in your own.[.][A][LF]
There's no mistake.[.][.....][LF]
Isn't it wonderful, Amelia?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
