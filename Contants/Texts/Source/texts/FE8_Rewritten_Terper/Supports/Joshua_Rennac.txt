Gah.[A][N][MoveMidRight]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hey there fella![A][N]
What's got you so glum? You[N]
look like you lost a bag of gold.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
More like never found the bag[N]
to begin with.[A][N]
It's this blasted job.[N]
All this fighting, and for what?[A][N]
The pay is never enough to[N]
justify the risk.[A][N]
Honestly, how do you stomach it?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Heh, you're all about the gold, huh?[A][N]
I guess I fight for the thrill,[N]
not the reward.[A][N]
You could say it's a gamble[N]
I can't resist.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
A gamble? That explains a lot.[A][N]
You're just as crazy as those fanatics[N]
who charge into battle without thinking.[A][N]
Look, I prefer certainty- like a fat[N]
sack of gold in my hand.[A][N]
Not... whatever this is.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
You mean adventure? Fun? Living life[N]
on the edge?[A][N]
Come on, buddy, there's more to[N]
life than coin.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I'll take my chances with the coin,[A][N]
thanks.[A][N]
I leave the 'adventure' to lunatics[N]
like you.[A][N]
[MoveFarFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
Gone.[A][N]
He's got fast legs.[A][N]
[MoveLeft]
...Wonder how fast he can run[N]
out of a casino...[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft]
Hey there.[A][N]
Looks like we keep running[N]
into each other.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...Despite my best efforts to[N]
the contrary...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
?[A] What was that?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
N-never you mind![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hmm okay.[A][N]
You seem like a guy with a[N]
lot of secrets anyway.[A][N]
Which kinda got me wondering;[N]
why are you out here?[A][N]
You don't exactly seem thrilled[N]
with any of this.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Throughly observant, aren't you?[A][N]
I'm here because I was hired. That's it.[A][N]
Princess L'Arachel practically dragged[N]
me along.[A][N]
I swear, the only reason I haven't[N]
bolted is because she's got deep pockets.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Didn't you say last time that you[N]
weren't getting paid enough?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm not, but find me somewhere[N]
I can make more coin.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hmm, actually I might have[N]
just the place in mind.[A][N]
There's a little casino near[N]
here I know of.[A][N]
Used to throw a few paychecks[N]
in there back in the day.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Lose them you mean.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...that obvious huh?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
You don't exactly scream[N]
"Good with money".[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
S-shut up![A][N]
Anyway, are you in or not?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Eh... why not?[A][N]
I could do with the distraction.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
All right, let's rob 'em blind.[A][X]

[OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
*Huff* *huff*, ha, hahaha...!![A][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
*Huff* you absolute godforsaken[N]
lunatic![A][N]
When you said "rob them blind",[N]
I didn't think you meant literally![A][N]
I feel like I lost 10 years of my[N]
life back there...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh come on, you were the one that[N]
said you were bored watching me play.[A][N]
Figured I'd spice up your life![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
You bet almost everything we had![A][N]
If I didn't take over you'd[N]
have bet yourself next.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Maybe, but look at the bright side,[N]
we made out like bandits![A][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
We'll be lucky if we have any[N]
time to spend it, fool![A][N]
We probably already have[N]
bounties on our heads![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hahaha, that doesn't sound[N]
so bad.[A][N]
It'll keep the game lively![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
What game? How does that even[N]
make sen--[A][N]
[CloseEyes]
Ah to hell with it![A][N]
[OpenEyes]
Put your money where your mouth[N]
is you scoundrel.[A][N]
Let's make a bet.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh?[N]
What have you got in mind?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I bet I can stay alive[N]
longer than you.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Ha that sounds like-[A][N]
Wait, if you die how am I[N]
supposed to collect?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
There's more to life than[N]
coin, right?[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Cheeky git.[A][X]

## Epilogue_Joshua_Rennac
After the war, Joshua returned to[N]
Jehanna and reclaimed his birthright[N]
as the nation's king, though he ruled[N]
with the same carefree attitude that[N]
had defined his wandering years. Rather[N]
than fully committing to the life of a[N]
monarch, Joshua allowed himself frequent[N]
trips across the continent. During which[N]
he kept in touch with a grumbly rouge who[N]
had reinvigorated his love for gambling[N]
and adventure.[X]

## Epilogue_Rennac_Joshua
Rennac left behind the chaos of war,[N]
retreating to a life of luxury and comfort.[N]
However, he soon found that his wealth was[N]
not as satisfying as he had hoped. His days[N]
were often interrupted by unexpected visits[N]
from Joshua, who frequently invited him to[N]
join new escapades, much to Rennacâ€™s[N]
irritation.[X]
