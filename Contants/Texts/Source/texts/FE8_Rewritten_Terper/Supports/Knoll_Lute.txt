Knoll![A][N]
I’ve been meaning to talk to you.[A][N]
You seem to possess a unique[N]
understanding of magic.[A][N] 
There’s something about the energy 
you wield...[A][N]
it’s not like anything I’ve seen before.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Lute... You’ve noticed, then.[N]
I’m not surprised.[A][N]
Your grasp of the arcane is formidable,[N]
and my magic draws from... unique sources.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
“Unique”? That’s a rather vague term.[N]
I need specifics.[A][N]
Is it ancient magic? Forbidden?[A][N]
You see, I’ve studied countless grimoires,[N]
but your spells...[A][N]
They feel like they belong to a[N]
different time.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
You’re perceptive. My magic draws upon[N]
dark energies, not of this world...[A][N]
Remnants of a lost time. But it’s not[N]
something I can easily explain.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Not explain? That’s absurd.[N]
Everything can be explained.[A][N]
I’ll simply observe more closely[N]
until I unravel the mystery.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I would caution you, Lute.[A][N]
There are things in this world that[N]
are better left undiscovered.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Nonsense. Discovery is the very heart[N]
of magic.[A][N]
The more dangerous, the more interesting.[A][N]
Perhaps we should continue this conversation[N]
once I’ve gathered more data.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Very well. But be wary.[N]
Knowledge comes at a price.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Knoll]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Lute]
Knoll, I’ve been analyzing your magic,[N]
and I’ve come to a conclusion.[A][N]
Your magic has ties to the demon king.[A][N]
You're channeling remnants of[N]
his essence in your spells.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
You're... not far from the truth.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
Fascinating! So, by tapping into this[N]
ancient energy, you’ve unlocked untold power.[A][N] 
But you seem... restrained. You’re not using[N] 
it to its full potential, are you?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
No. The power I draw from comes at a great cost.[N]
The more I use it, the more I lose... of myself.[A][N] 
It’s a burden, not a blessing.[N]
Grado’s collapse was proof of that.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I see. So it’s a delicate balance...[A][N]
Hm. You know, I would have used that power[N]
to advance my studies further.[A][N]
No sacrifice is too great for knowledge,[N]
after all.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
That is precisely why I fear for you,[N]
Lute.[A][N]
You remind me of... myself, before I understood 
the consequences.[A][N]
You’re driven, but there are limits that[N]
should not be crossed.
[OpenEyes]
[OpenMidRight]
Limits? Limits are an obstacle to be overcome.[N]
Knowledge without risk is incomplete.[A][N]
Besides, what’s the worst that could happen?[N]
We both know I’m a prodigy.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Even a prodigy can be consumed by[N]
forces they cannot control.[A][N]
You may find the cost is more than[N]
you bargained for.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Hmm... You may have a point. But I’m still[N]
not convinced. Perhaps we’ll see, in time.[A][X]

## A_Support_Knoll_Lute
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Knoll]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Lute]
Knoll, I’ve been thinking about what you said.[A][N]
About the cost of knowledge, the danger in[N]
seeking too far.[A][N]
It’s not that I doubt myself, but...[N]
What exactly did you lose?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
...Everything.[A] My peers, my mentors... even[N]
my own sense of purpose.[A][N]
When we delved too deeply into ancient magics,[N]
we unearthed what should have remained buried.[A][N]
The price was... unimaginable.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Hmm. So that’s why you’re so withdrawn,[N]
so cautious.[A][N]
You’ve seen what happens when knowledge[N]
overwhelms the seeker.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Yes. It’s why I’m... like this.[N]
The pursuit of knowledge is a noble thing,[A][N]
but at a point it can become... destructive.[N]
For yourself, and for those around you.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...I suppose I’ve always thought myself invincible.[N]
That nothing could stand in the way of my intellect.[A][N]
But if what you say is true... perhaps I should[N]
be more careful.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
You have the potential to achieve great things, Lute.[N]
Far greater than I ever could.[A][N]
But there is wisdom in understanding when to stop.[N]
Not all knowledge is meant to be grasped.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Hm. That’s not easy for me to accept. But... 
you’ve shown me something I hadn’t considered.[A][N]
Perhaps the measure of a truly great scholar is[N]
knowing when to turn away. I’ll keep that in mind.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
It’s rare to find someone who understands that[N]
balance.[A][N]
I hope, for your sake, you don’t have to learn[N]
it the hard way as I did.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Don’t worry, Knoll. I’m smarter than you.[N]
I’ll figure it out without making your mistakes.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Heh... I truly hope you’re right.[A][X]

## Epilogue_Knoll_Lute
Knoll, having witnessed the downfall of[N]
Grado and understanding the peril of delving[N]
too deep into forbidden magic, left the[N]
battlefield to live a life of quiet contemplation.[N]
He retreated to a remote part of Magvel, where he[N]
dedicated himself to chronicling the rise and fall[N]
of his homeland, documenting the untold histories[N]
and ancient magics that had once fascinated him,[N]
but now served as a stark reminder of the price of[N]
ambition. Occasionally, word would spread of a[N]
scholar wandering the lands, offering cryptic advice[N]
to those seeking knowledge of the arcane. His[N]
reputation grew among those who sought wisdom, though[N]
few ever knew his true identity. Knoll became a[N]
figure of quiet legend, the man who had glimpsed the[N]
abyss and chose to turn away from it, living in the[N]
shadows of history as a keeper of forgotten truths.[X]

## Epilogue_Lute_Knoll
Lute, on the other hand, continued her meteoric rise[N]
through the academic circles of Renais. Her talent[N]
was undeniable, and her name became known far and[N]
wide as one of the most brilliant minds of her time.[N]
She advanced the study of magic with unparalleled[N]
fervor, publishing numerous treatises that[N]
revolutionized magical theory. However, Lute never[N]
forgot the warnings Knoll had imparted to her during[N]
their time together. As the years passed, Lute found[N]
herself on the brink of uncovering a powerful secret,[N]
one that could grant her nearly limitless magical[N]
ability. Yet, standing before the final threshold of[N]
her research, she paused. Knoll’s words echoed in her[N]
mind—Not all knowledge is meant to be grasped.[N]
For the first time in her life, Lute hesitated.[N]
After days of contemplation, she made the difficult[N]
decision to seal away her findings, safeguarding them[N]
from those who might misuse them. Though she continued[N]
her studies, Lute did so with a newfound respect for[N]
the dangers that knowledge could bring. She remained[N]
confident, even boastful of her abilities, but there[N]
was a hint of maturity in her actions, a careful[N]
restraint that had not been there before. In private,[N]
she would often reflect on her time with Knoll,[N]
wondering what path her life might have taken had[N]
she ignored his warnings. She would never admit it[N]
out loud, but in those quiet moments, she was grateful[N]
for his influence.[X]
