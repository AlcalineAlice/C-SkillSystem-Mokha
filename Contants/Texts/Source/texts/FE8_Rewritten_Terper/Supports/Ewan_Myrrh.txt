Hey, Myrrh! How’re you doing today?[A]
You're always so quiet, y'know?[N]
Thought I'd come and check on you.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh... Hello, Ewan... right?[A][N]
I'm... fine, thank you. I just like[N]
being... alone sometimes.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yeah, I get that. But don’t you[N]
get lonely?[A][N]
I mean, we’re in a big army now.[N]
There’s a lot of people to talk to.[A][N]
Isn’t that exciting?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
It’s a bit overwhelming... I’m not used[N]
to being around so many people.[A][N]
Back home, it was always just me[N]
and… Father.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
That’s right! You lived in Darkling[N]
Woods, huh?[A][N]
Must’ve been super quiet there.[A][N]
You probably never had noisy brothers[N]
to mess with you like I do. Haha![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh, you have siblings?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, just an older sister really.[A][N]
But the guys in this mercenary group[N]
I belong to are like brothers to me.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
I've never had any siblings, I've[N]
wondered what it was like.[A][N]
[OpenEyes]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hmm, I get it. Well, if you ever[N]
need to talk, just find me![A][N]
I know I’m a handful, but I can[N]
be good company![A][N]
We’ll make sure you’re not[N]
feeling lonely, okay?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...Thank you, Ewan.[N]
You're very kind.[A][N]

[OpenMidLeft]
Hey, Myrrh! There you are.[A][N]
What’re you up to today?[N]
Reading something?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh… No, I was just thinking.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Thinking, huh? About what?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
About humans… and how different[N]
we are.[A][N]
Everyone is so full of energy,[N]
and I feel… slow in comparison.[A][N]
I’m not used to moving at such a pace.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Ah, I see![A][N]
Yeah, adults are always rushing around[N]
liket they don’t have enough time.[A][N]
Maybe it’s because we don’t live[N]
as long as you do?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps... My kind, the Manakete,[N]
we live much longer than humans.[A][N]
Maybe that’s why I... can’t always[N]
understand your ways.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
Whoa, that’s amazing![A][N]
You get to see so much more of[N]
the world than we ever could.[A][N]
I bet you’ve got all sorts of[N]
cool stories![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I do, but… sometimes it’s hard[N]
to watch things change so quickly.[N][A]
I’ve seen forests grow and die,[N]
people come and go.[A][N]
It makes me wonder if I really[N]
belong in this world.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Hmm... but hey, you’re here now,[N]
right?[A][N]
That means you belong, at least[N]
to us![A][N]
I think you've got a lot in common[N]
with us than you think.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Do you really think so?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Absolutely![A][N]
I mean, you worry, you care, you[N]
feel sad and happy, just like us.[A][N]
You just have a different perspective.[N]
And that’s pretty awesome if you ask me![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Thank you, Ewan. I...[N]
feel a little better hearing that.[A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Myrrh]
Ewan, can I… ask you something?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Sure! Ask away.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
You always seem so… cheerful.[A]
Even in the middle of all this[N]
fighting. How do you stay so positive?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hmm, good question![N]
I guess it’s because I’m always learning.[A][N]
Every day, there’s something new—new magic, 
new people, new experiences.[A][N]
I like discovering things![A]
And when I’m learning,[N]
it’s hard to feel down, you know?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
You… enjoy learning?[N]
Even with all the danger around you?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yeah! It’s like, even in tough times,[N]
there’s always something to hold onto.[A][N]
Plus, I’ve got people I care about[N]
to fight for.[A][N]
That makes it all worth it.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
People you care about... I see.[A]
I’ve always been alone, so... I didn’t
know what that felt like.[A][N]
But now, with all of you...[N]
I think I understand.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yeah! See? You’ve got people[N]
who care about you now.[A][N]
Like me, for example![A][N]
So you don’t need to feel alone[N]
anymore, Myrrh. We’ve got your back.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...Thank you, Ewan. You’ve made me[N]
realize something important.[A][N]
Even though I’m not human... that[N]
doesn't mean we can't be friends.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
That’s the spirit![A][N]
You’re just like the rest of us,[N]
Myrrh.[A][N]
A little different, sure, but that[N]
just makes you even cooler![A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Thank you. I’ll do my best to[N]
protect everyone… especially you.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Heh, sounds like a deal![A]
Let’s watch each other’s backs[N]
out there![A][X]

## Epilogue_Ewan_Myrrh
After the war ended, Ewan’s hunger for[N]
knowledge only grew. He continued his[N]
studies in magic, traveling far and wide[N]
to learn from the most experienced sages[N]
and scholars. With his boundless enthusiasm[N]
and curiosity, Ewan eventually became a[N]
renowned sage, his magical abilities[N]
rivaling even those of his master, Saleh.[N]
But no matter how far he traveled or how[N]
much he learned, he always remembered the[N]
Friends he made during the war, especially[N]
Myrrh. It was said that Ewan’s most powerful[N]
spells were inspired by the wisdom Myrrh[N]
shared with him, and that Myrrh’s heart, once[N]
burdened by loneliness, was forever warmed[N]
by the lighthearted mage who saw her as more[N]
than just a dragon, but as a cherished friend.[X]

## Epilogue_Myrrh_Ewan
Myrrh, having seen the horrors of war and the[n]
beauty of human companionship, decided to stay[N]
in contact with the human world. Though she[N]
returned to the safety of Darkling Woods for a[N]
time. The bond she formed with Ewan reminded[N]
her that even though her life span was far[N]
greater than that of humans, the connections[N]
she made were just as valuable. In time, she[N]
learned to balance her Manakete nature with[N]
the lessons she learned from Ewan and the[N]
others. Ewan often visited Myrrh in Darkling[N]
Woods, sharing with her his latest discoveries[N]
and stories of the outside world. The two[N]
maintained their deep friendship, and in the[N]
quiet moments when they sat together,[N]
surrounded by ancient trees, they would talk[N]
about the fleeting nature of life and how,[N]
despite their differences, they had found[N]
something eternal in each other’s company.[X]
