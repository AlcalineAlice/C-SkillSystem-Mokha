Ah, Saleh of Caer Pelyn![N]
I've been searching for you.[A][N]
You must join me on my most[N]
righteous quest to rid the world of evil.[A][N]
Together, we can smite all[N]
forms of wickedness![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Princess L'Arachel.[A][N]
I appreciate your... enthusiasm.[A][N]
But my current duty is to protect[N]
my village.[A][N]
And by extension, assist Prince Ephraim[N]
and Princess Eirika.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Duty, you say?[N]
Noble, indeed.[A][N]
However, fighting evil is not merely[N]
a duty- it is a calling![A][N]
I sense that deep within you,[N]
Saleh.[A][N]
There lies a passion to protect the[N]
innocent and bring justice to all.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
My people value peace and wisdom[N]
above all else.[A][N]
Conflict is not something we seek[N]
unless it is unavoidable.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][BoxHeight_3]
Hmm, yes, peace is all well and good[N]
but you must have an unyielding resolve[N]
to act when necessary![A][N]
[OpenMidRight][BoxHeight_2]
.....[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
You, of all people, should know that evil[N]
will not rest while we sit idly by.[A][N]
Come, don't you wish to see the[N]
world purified of all malevolence?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I seek balance, Princess L'Arachel.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Balance, with the forces[N]
of darkness?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][BoxHeight_3]
Evil and good may be opposites in this world,[N]
but peace lies in understanding them,[N]
not in simply eradicating one.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][BoxHeight_2]
Interesting... I have not[N]
considered it from that angle.[A][N]
Well, then! Perhaps we will discuss[N]
this further in the future.[A][N]
Farewell for now, Saleh![A][X]

Saleh, I’ve been thinking about our[N]
last conversation.[A][N]
You spoke of balance, 
and it intrigued me.[A][N]
Tell me more of this “balance” you
seek.[A][N]
