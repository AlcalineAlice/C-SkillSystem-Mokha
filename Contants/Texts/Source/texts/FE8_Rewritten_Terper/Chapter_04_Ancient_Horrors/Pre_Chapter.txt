We're approaching Serafew, at the[N]
border of Renais and Grado.[A][N]
Once we cross, we'll be in Grado...[N]
Renvall won't be much further.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I see...[A][N]
Hm...? Seth![N]
Look! Over there![A][N]

Those strange figures...[N]
What... what are they?[A][N]
Are they... walking... bones?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I've never seen anything like this...![A][N]
What manner of being are they?[A][N]

What have we done to deserve the trials[N]
before us?[A] What is happening to us?[A][N]
How could such things walk out lands[N]
while the Sacred Stones protect us?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
.....[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Lute, please, it's dangerous outside[N]
the walls.[N] Stay here in the village.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Those are the undead, aren't they?[A][N]
They were the soldiers of the Demon[N]
King in the Days of Darkness.[A][N]
The Tome of Za'nazania describes them.[A][N]
Chapter two, section seven,[N]
paragraph eight.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Y-You know of them?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Duh! I'm a prodigy. I can recall[N]
most everything I see or hear.[A][N]
According to the book, those big fleshy ones,[N]
revenants, attack using razor-sharp claws.[A][N]
Sounds painful, wouldn't you say?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, er, well... be that as it may, I[N]
must go aid those travelers outside.[A][N]
You shoud stay here within the[N]
safety of the village.[A][N]
Oh, very well..[A][N]
I don't mind staying here.[A][N]
In fat it seems the[N]
smarter choice.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
Magic is far more powerful than any[N]
legend's claws.[A][N]
Even if this village were to be assaulted[N]
by monsters, I can defend it perfectly.[A][N]
...?[N]
Oh, already left.[A][X]

Travelers, you must listen to me![A][N]
The forest of Za'ha is dangerous![A][N]
Head south and pass through this place[N]
before the dead surround you![A][N]
[OpenLeft]
W-who are you?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
My name is Artur.[A][N]
The temple has assigned me the task of[N]
cleansing the forest of these... undead.[A][N]
There are so many of them though...[N]
I wonder if I stand much of a chance alone.[A][N]
So if you could, please flee now while[N]
you have the chance.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
The undead?[A][N]
You're not talking about the same ones[N]
that served the ancient Demon King?[A][N]
That can't be right... they're nothing[N]
but legends and fairy tales...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, I felt the same when I heard.[A][N]
And yet here they are.[A][N]
This place is filled with them.[A][N]
I wonder how far they've spread...[N]
I can only hope it is only in this area.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
But... why are they here?[A] How?[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace_Seth]
!! Your Highness![A][X]

Allow me![A][X]

We have to help him![A][N]
If we don't, innocent people[N]
are sure to suffer![A][N]
Let's hurry.[A][X]
