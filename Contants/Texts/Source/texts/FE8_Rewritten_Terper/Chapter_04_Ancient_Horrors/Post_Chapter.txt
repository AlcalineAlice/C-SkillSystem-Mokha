[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Artur]
Everything is all[N]
right now, Lute.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
.....[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Lute?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Your flesh shows no signs of putrefaction.[A][N]
It seems you're not a revenant.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, I should hope not![A][N]
However, I'm obligied to help the ones[N]
who aided me against those fiends.[A][N]
So I'm afraif I'll be leaving you and[N]
traveling with them for a while.[A][N]
What will you do, Lute?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
That's a good question. A very good[N]
question indeed. Hmm...[A][N]
I've decided. I'll join you, Artur.[A][N]
After all, who wouldn't appreciate the[N]
help of a mage such as myself?[A][N]
There's no one better than me.[A][X]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace_Eirika]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace_Seth]
We've killed all the... undead.[A][N]
Still, we'd best burn the bones to[N]
ash to be sure they won't return.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
I still can't believe what we've[N]
been fighting here.[A][N]
I'd thought those nothing[N]
more than myth and legend.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Are they truly... the risen dead?[A][N]
Is such a thing possible?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Oh, yes, absolutely.[A][N]
Some of these villagers said they only[N]
buried some of them weeks ago.[A][N]
Yes, we're in for some trouble. Even my[N]
fabulous power may not be enough.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Princess Eirika.[A][N]
If you do not mind, would I be able[N]
to join you on your journey?[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
! You realized who I am?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, Sir Seth did call you "Highness"[N]
as the enemy approached.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Ah![A][N] ...
I apologize, Princess.[A][N]
I did not mean to...[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Please, Seth, it is no problem.[A][N]
Brother Artur... are you sure?[A][N]
Should you not return to your temple?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I worry about the source of these[N]
undead.[A][N]
I have the feeling...[N]
that I can find it alongside you.[A][N]
The voice of the Heavens, perhaps.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
And I, of course, will join[N]
you as well.[A][N]
You simply cannot allow one[N]
such as I to sit on the sidelines.[A][N]
Not when legends walk[N]
the earth![A][N]
Oh, and I simply cannot let[N]
Artur out of my sight.[A][N]
He can be such a simpleton when[N]
it come to women.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]
Who knows what doey-eyed ne'er-do-well[N]
he'd fall victim to without me.[A][N]
[OpenRight][MoveRight]
L-Lute that's quite enough![A][N]
[OpenFarRight][OpenEyes]
I speak naught but the unblemished[N]
truth.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Haha, I see.[A] Very well, you can[N]
join as well, Lute.[A][N]
We'd be glad to have you.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
By the Stones...[N]
what is happening to our land?[A][N]
Is this all a dream?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Seth]
...Princess Eirika, perhaps it would be[N]
wise to return to Frelia and regroup.[A][N]
Pressing forward seems foolish in[N]
light of recent events.[A][N]
If we risk running into these beings[N]
again, then...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...No. In fact, now may be[N]
the best time to move forward.[A][N]
Grado's forces may well be preoccupied[N]
with these undead.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...I understand.[A][N]
Then let us move on.[A][X]

## Chapter_04_Scene_10_Convo_01
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Ross]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Garcia]
Ross![A][N]
You're okay![A][N]
[MoveLeft]
Come with me, I'm taking[N]
you away from here.[A][N]
It's not safe.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
No dad, stop![A][N]
[OpenLeft][MoveFarRight]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]
[BoxHeight_3]
The whole reason I left in the[N]
first place is BECAUSE I didn't[N]
feel safe.[A][N]
[BoxHeight_2]
[OpenMidRight]
...![A][N]
[BoxHeight_3]
[OpenMidLeft]
First it was bandits, then I was[N]
scared it going to be Grado's[N]
soldiers next.[A][N]
But look around dad, look at[N]
what we've just been fighting.[A][N]
Now we're having to fight the[N]
the risen dead.[A][N]
The only reason we stood a damn[N]
chance is because we fought as[N]
a group.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]
If we didn't stop them here,[N]
these monsters would have made[N]
their way to our home...[A][N]
[BoxHeight_2]
[OpenMidRight]
Son...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace_Seth]
Sir Garcia, if I may interject?[A][N]
I know you have your grievances about[N]
lending your aid to Renais once again.[A][N]
But your son speaks the truth when he[N]
talks about the peril of our plight.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
.....[A][N]
[BoxHeight_3]
[OpenFarLeft]
Having discussed the matter with[N]
Princess Eirika, I now concur it[N]
would be safest to travel together.[A][N]
In her kindness, she has kept your[N]
son safe from harm, because she[N]
cannot bear to see children afraid.[A][N]
And she will continue to do so,[N]
because that is who she is at[N]
her core.[A][N]
[BoxHeight_2]
[OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
*Haah*...[A][N]
When you put it like that I[N]
would be rude to refuse.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Then?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][OpenEyes]
Tell your Princess I'll join[N]
your group for now.[A][N]
At least until these threats[N]
are dealt with.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
I will inform her promptly.[A][N]
Thank you, Sir Garcia.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I knew you'd come around dad![A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
I wouldn't say that.[A][N]
But this Princess Eirika may be[N]
worth keeping an eye on...[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Eirika]
[OpenRight][LoadFace_Larachel]
Aha! Foul undead, beware![A][N]
I, L'Arachel bestow upon you the honor[N]
of banishment at our blessed hands.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
.....[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Oh... excuse me, Madam!
Where are the monsters?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, we just finished[N]
them off...[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Oh. Ah! Glad tidings indeed![N]
The Heavens must be rejoicing![A][N]
We are... a tad disappointed however.[A][N]
After all, we dud rush all the way here[N]
to show you the splendor our our might.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Dozla]
Gwah ha ha! It's a real shame,[N]
innit, my lady?![A][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Rennac]
What's really shameful is the way you[N]
drag us around the countryside.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
Um... pardon me, but... who are you?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Ah, little old me?[A][N]
Since you ask, please allow us[N]
to introduce ourselves.[A][N]
We are: The true light and glory[N]
of the sacred realm of Rausten...[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Dozla]
Stop! My lady, you[N]
musn't continue![A][N]
You cannot reveal your[N]
true identity here![A][N]
[OpenRight]
Oh! Yes, yes, you're right! Oh, we get[N]
so careless sometimes.[A][N]
Now, we must ride off in anonymity.[A][N]
Oh, how beautifully romantic![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
???[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Fare thee well, strangers![N]
Perhaps our paths will cross again![A][N]
We ride![A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight]
Gwah ha ha![N]
Let's go, Rennac![A][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Rennac]
Argh... All right, all right.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
...[A][N]
Why do I keep running into so[N]
many strange girls today?[A][N]
Rausten... she seems too finely[N]
dressed to be a commoner.[A][N]
I wonder who she could be?[A][X]

## Chapter_04_Scene_12_Convo_01
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Ross]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Garcia]
Son, about what I said earlier...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
It's fine dad, I was stupid, I get it.[A][N]
[OpenEyes]
[OpenMidRight]
No... I don't think so.[A][N]
[CloseEyes][BoxHeight_3]
I've had some time to reflect.[A][N]
[OpenEyes]
And it's not apparent to me you[N]
made the decision that made the[N]
most sense to you.[A][N]
[ToggleSmile]
And if that shove was any indication[N]
you've gotten stronger when my[N]
back was turned.[A][N]
[BoxHeight_2]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Thanks, Dad.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
I had planned on giving this to[N]
you when you were older.[A][N]
But it looks like you're[N]
more ready than I thought.[A][N]
I'm proud of you, son.[A][X]
