This is terrible..![A] What are we going[N]
to do?[A] Those bandits are so close...[A][N]
If we can't find some way to protect[N]
ourselves, the village is doomed...![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Eirika]
People, listen to me![A] You must close[N]
the village gates immediately.[A][N]
Hurry, before the bandits arrive![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Hm?[A] Who are you?[A] You aren't from one[N]
of the neighbouring towns, are you?[A][N]
And your weapons give you away...[N]
You're no peasant.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I am...[A] My name is Erda.[A][N]
I'm a mercenary.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
A mercenary, is it?[A][N]
And named after the late Queen[N]
of Renais, Erdalinde, I assume?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, ...she was loved by her--[A][N]
by my family, so...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Perfectly reasonable.[A][N]
Though I never had the pleasure of a[N]
meeting, I'm told she was quite enchanting.[A][N]
Ah, I haven't introduced myself, have I?[A][N]
I am Selena, a general in Grado's army.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
...!![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Do you take issue with that?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...No, of course not.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Heh, very well.[A][N]
It looks like these villagers[N]
have some bandit troubles.[A][N]
I would like to help, but[N]
I have my orders.[A][N]
I'm to leave for the capital[N]
immediately, and so I cannot stay.[A][N]
You're armed, and you claim to be[N]
a mercenary.[A] Will you help them?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Is there a problem?[A][N]
If it's a matter of payment, then--[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
N-no![A] Of course I'll help them![A][N]
It's just... you're one of[N]
Grado's generals... so why would...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...These aren't soldiers.[A][N]
They're people.[A][N]
Should they suffer because[N]
their leaders fight?[A][N]
I've petitioned your aid.[A][N]
Take this as payment.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFaceFancy_Selena][FlipRight]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]
W-wait please![A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
What is it?[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
You're one of the imperial three,[N]
so you should know.[A][N]
Why, why did Emperor Vigarde[N]
start this senseless war?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
He didn't.[A][N]
He...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Didn't what?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][BoxType_InnerMonologue]
This whole situation is madness...[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidRight]
Wait what does that mean?[A][N]
Selena![A][X]
