You saved my son...[A][N]
Thank you.[A] Truly, thank you...[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
I'm glad he's safe.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
...Hold on a moment...[A][N]
Aren't you... the great Garcia?[A][N]
You fought for Renais, didn't you?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
.....[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Seth?[A] Do you know this man?[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
He was a troop commander for Renais[N]
until around ten years ago.[A][N]
When I was a recruit, the soldiers[N]
used to tell so many tales about him.[A][N]
They called him a daring and fearless[N]
warrior of Renais.[A][N]
A living legend, if you will.[A][N]
Master Garcia, you must know the peril[N]
our homeland faces right now.[A][N]
Can we impose on you to lend your[N]
strength to Renais once more?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...I'm sorry.[A] I'm retired now.[A][N]
I'm not a soldier anymore.[A][N]
It's... a decision I made long ago.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
But, Master Garcia...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm no master.[A][N]
When I was a soldier, I lived my[N]
life fighting for my country's honor.[A][N]
I left no time for my family.[A][N]
I spent my life fighting for faceless,[N]
uncaring nobles.[A][N]
When my wife fell ill and died, I met[N]
the child she had left behind...[A][N]
At that moment, I finally realized[N]
what my duty had cost me.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
...!![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I stood by my wife's grave and promised[N]
her I would be a father to our son.[A][N]
I'm done with armies.[A] I'm done with[N]
fighting, except to protect my son.[A][N]
I've no regrets.[A] I'm the boy's father.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
.....[A][N]
I see.[A] I apologize, Sir Garcia.[A][N]

Dad![A] You... you blasted fool![A][N]
What's all this[N]
I'm hearing?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Ross![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
If you're not going, I will![A][N]
I'm a fighter![A][N]
I know I can do this![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
[MoveRight]
Ross, what are you saying?[A][N]
I...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Dad, please![A] Listen to me![A][N]
I respect you more than any[N]
other man in this world.[A][N]
I know you gave up being a[N]
soldier for me.[A] I know that![A][N]
But how can you throw away[N]
such a big part of yourself?[A][N]
You're a warrior at heart![A] I know you are![A][N]
You can't give that up and be happy![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
.....[A][N]
It doesn't matter, son.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Dad![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
As you just heard my obsession[N]
with fighting cost us both dearly.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
.....[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
We can never get back what[N]
we've lost.[A][N]
All we can do is learn from it.[A][N]
So that it never happens again.[A][N]
I'm done fighting Renais' battles,[N]
her fate is not my concern.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Dad... I can't even begin to imagine[N]
what you felt when mom died, but--[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I hope you never do son.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
[MoveMidLeft]
But if we don't--[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I won't lend my strength to a nation that[N]
didn't help us in our hour of need.[A][N]
We'll stay as far away from this[N]
war as we can.[A][N]
Let that be the end of it.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
.....[A][X]

## Chapter_02_Scene_09_Convo_01
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Eirika]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_CivilianMan1]
Thank you so much for your help.[A][N]
Please, stay the night and rest...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
We would if we could, but we have[N]
much to do and far to travel.[A][N]
Knowing that your people are safe[N]
is morale enough to keep us strong.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Truly...?[A][N]
Hearts as kind as yours are[N]
rare milady.[A][N]
But please, be careful.[A][N]
Since Renais was invaded, things have[N]
become so dangerous around here.[A][N]
There are gold-hungry thieves and[N]
bandits everywhere.[A][N]
The most wicked are Bazba's bandits.[A][N]
They are... cruel beyond words.[A][N]
If you have something they want, your[N]
life is worth less than nothing.[A][N]
Just the other day, they assaulted some[N]
travelers and... oh, it was awful.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
.....[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh Renais is finished, mark my words.[A][N]
Grado has stolen our future.[A][N]
Our only hope against them was that[N]
Prince Ephraim would prevail, but...[A][N]
Rumor has it that he's on the verge of[N]
being crushed by Grado's vast numbers.[A][N]
These are dark days.[A] Travel with care.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Please, be safe...[A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_EirikaPast]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_EphraimPast]
Right then, time to start.[A][N]
Ready, Eirika?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Y-yes, Ephraim.[A][N]
Let's begin![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Tell me, though.[A][N]
Why do you want me to teach[N]
you how to fight?[A][N]
I thought you didn't care for it?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I do not like... uncivilized behaviour.[A][N]
I want to believe that one can solve[N]
one's problems without violence.[A][N]
But...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
But...?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I've always, always relied on you to[N]
protect me, brother.[A][N]
I don't want to...[A][N]
I would rather not be such a[N]
burden to you in the future.[A][N]
So I thought maybe I should[N]
learn to protect myself![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hey, it's what I'm here for.[A][N]
You're so good at all these other[N]
lordly things...[A][N]
I'd rather you not try and supplant[N]
me entirely![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I-I wouldn't![A] And I...[N]
still have a lot to learn.[A][N]
So I would like to learn something of[N]
swordplay, if only a little.[A][N]
And maybe, someday, I can protect you[N]
in your hour of need...[A][N]
So please, Ephraim![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hahaha... how could I say no?[A][N]
Honestly, once you get an idea into your[N]
head, that's it.[A] I might as well give in.[A][N]
Really, I'm happy that you're[N]
taking this so seriously.[A][N]
Give me a couple of days and I'll have you[N]
whipped up into a proper sparring partner![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I, uhm... think I'll need a little more[N]
than a few days, Ephraim...[A][X]

## Chapter_02_Scene_12_Convo_01
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Eirika]
Ephraim, I've become stronger.[A][N]
Soon, I'll be able to...[A]...[A][N]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace_Colm]
[MoveFarLeft]
Oops![A] Beg your pardon.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Oh![A][N]
No, pardon me, I wasn't--[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarFarRight]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
Gone...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Seth]
Princess, are you alright?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, of course.[A] Someone bumped into[N]
me is all.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Thank goodness.[A] ...Hm?[A][N]
Princess... where is your bracelet...?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]My bracelet?[A][N]
It's right h-- ...[A][N]
Where could it be?[A][N]
Did that man--[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Princess! We must be after him![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
O-of course![A][N]
Pray forgive me, Seth, I--[N]
I wasn't--[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
It is nothing to apologize for, Princess.[A][N]
The fault is mine alone.[A][N]
I ought not to have left[N]
your side.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Don't say such things, Seth.[A][N]
You were still coming to terms[N]
with Sir Garcia's refusal.[A][N]
Besides, I'm no longer in the castle.[A][N]
I must learn to stand on my own feet.[A][N]
More importantly, we need[N]
to chase that man down![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Of course, Princess![A][X]

Sorry, Dad.[A][N]
I know you mean well, but I don't[N]
feel safe here anymore.[A][N]
Please... come find me...[A][N]
