[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Joshua]
Well, well! There's an arena in town.[A][N]
Perfect. My pocket's feeling a bit light.[A][N]
Oh! Nevermind the arena![N]
Gorgeous woman, straight ahead![A][N]
Play it cool, Joshua.[A][X]

## Chapter_05_Scene_01_Convo_02
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Natasha][MoveMidRight]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Joshua]
Something amiss, Sister?[N]
You look flustered.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
Ah![A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Natasha]
P-pardon me.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
No, no, pardon me! I never meant[N]
to startle you.[A][N]
May I offer my apologies...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
No, it's not necessary...[N]
It was my fault.[A][N]
Excuse me, I-I must be going...[N]
Good day to you.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Welp, there she goes...[A][N]
Maybe I was a bit too cool.[A][N]
Not my lucky day...[N]
She was quite the beauty, too.[A][N]
Ah, such is life. I think I've time[N]
still to visit the arena, though.[A][X]

## Chapter_05_Scene_02_Convo_01
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Saar]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Glen]
Captain Saar. How fare you?[A][N]
I bring orders from his majesty.[A][N]
Rumor has it that Princess of Eirika of[N]
Renais is making her way to Grado.[A][N]
You are to find her and to place[N]
her into custody immediately.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
The Princess, is it? Yes, sir![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Aye.[A] Our true target is her[N]
brother, but he has proven... elusive.[A][N]
Taking her captive will lure the boy out.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Very good sir, I have already taken some[N]
countermeasures in that regard.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
General Caellach has seen fit to grant me[N]
command of a small retinue of troops.[A][N]
We have them disguised as merchants[N]
and refugees.[A][N]
They are reporting the Princess'[N]
movements to our operatives here.[A][N]
She will arrive in due time, General.[A][N]
That, I assure you.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...Good man.[A] Oh, and one more thing...[A][N]
A traitor to the empire has fled[N]
Castle Grado.[A][N]
A golden-haired member of the clergy.[A][N]
We've received reports she is hiding[N]
somewhere here in Serafew.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, sir, General Glen![A][N]
Do you wish her captured...[N]
or executed?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...I would prefer it if you kept her alive...[N]
But it is not my call to make.[A][N]
This is a request from General Riev,[N]
and he has requested her execution.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Understood! Grado's will be done.[A][N]
The Grado Empire will repay the[N]
debt of betrayl with blood![A][N]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
...[A][N][OpenEyes]
His Majesty relies on you, Captain.[A][N]
Make sure his trust is not misplaced.[A][N]
That is all.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, sir![A][X]

## Chapter_05_Scene_02_Convo_02
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Cormag]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Glen]
Such loyalty to the crown.[A][N]
...If only I could hold such conviction[N]
in the righteousness of our emperor...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hm? Something troubling you, Brother?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
No... pay no mind to me.[A][N]
Come, Cormag. Let's ride.[A][N]
From here, we head northeast,[N]
back to the fort.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Very well.[A][X]

## Chapter_05_Scene_03_Convo_01
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Seth]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Eirika]
It's been so long so I last[N]
visited Serafew...[A][N]
My brother and I used to pass[N]
through here en route to Grado.[A][N]
To me, this town...[A][N]
This border town between our people.[A][N]
It was a symbol of the trust[N]
between Grado and Renais.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...Indeed.[A][N]
We knights of both Renais and Grado...[A][N]
at times, we staged joint exercises[N]
near the northeastern fort.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
The peace I remember in this city...[A][N]
It seems like something from another[N]
time.[A] It seems... lost, now.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...The city doesn't seem to be very[N]
heavily patrolled.[A][N]
They must feel that it is not worth guarding[N]
with Castle Renais under their control.[A][N]
We must try to not draw attention[N]
to ourselves.[A][N]
Look, the west gate is undermanned...[A][N]
[OpenFarFarRight]
Pardon me, may I ask[N]
you a question?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace_Seth]
[OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace_Saleh][MoveMidRight]
[OpenFarLeft]
What is it?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm looking for someone.[A][N]
Have you seen a small girl[N]
with indigo hair?[A][N]
She's quite shy.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Oh, no... did you lose your daughter?[A][N]
I'm so sorry... we haven't seen her.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I see...[A][N]
Thank you.[N]
Sorry to intrude.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Not at all.[A][N]
Do you want aid in looking for her?[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Pr- Lady Erda, we really cannot-[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
No, no. I will be fine[N]
on my own, thank you.[A][N]
May the Stones bless you.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft]
Poor girl...[A][N]
Let us see if we can't find her[N]
on our way through town, Seth.[A][N]
[MoveFarFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Princess...[A][N]
Why are you...?[A][X]

## Chapter_05_Scene_03_Convo_02
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace_Seth]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace_Eirika]
I can't see any girl as he described[N]
anywhere...[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Hm. He didn't strike me as a[N]
Grado spy, but...[A][N]
[OpenFarFarRight]
Catch her! Dont let her escape![A][N]
[OpenFarFarRight]
That way! She[N]
went that way![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
What's happening?[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
It sounds like it's coming[N]
from further in town...[A][N]
Princess, we should le-[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Let's hurry and see what the[N]
commotion is.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
...Yes, Your Highness.[A][X]

## Chapter_05_Scene_04_Convo_01
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Natasha]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_SoldierBrown]
Traitor![N]
Surrender peacefully![A][N]
Come quietly, and you may have the chance[N]
to explain yourself before His Majesty.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Please, wait![N]
You must listen to me![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Seize her![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
No! You must believe me![A][N]
The emperor is not himself![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
You MUST be able to see that![A][N]
Bishop Riev-[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
To impugn our Emperor! The gal![A][N]
You must be longing for[N]
execution![A][X]

## Chapter_05_Scene_04_Convo_02
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Joshua]
Did I hear something about[N]
an execution?[A][N]
What's wrong gents, did she[N]
turn you down too?[A][N]
A bit pathetic to move straight[N]
to murdering the poor lass.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_SoldierBrown]
Hold your tongue, you filthy[N]
sellsword![A][N]
This woman is guilty of high treason[N]
against the empire![A][N]
Intefere, and you will receive the[N]
same punishment![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Treason, eh? And here I thought she[N]
was just a pretty face.[A][N]
Did she turn the emperor down[N]
as well?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]
You dare to mock His Majesty?![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Hahaha! I've made up my mind then![A][N]
The lady ain't going with you.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
You must have a death wish,[N]
you third-rate mercenary.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
...You're half right.[A][N]
I probably do have a death wish.[A][X]

## Chapter_05_Scene_04_Convo_03
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Joshua]
But third rate? Never.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_SoldierBrown]
W-waah! Commander Saar![A][X]

## Chapter_05_Scene_04_Convo_04
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Natasha]
T-thank you kindly, sir.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Joshua]
"Sir" eh? Been a long time since[N]
someone was formal with me.[A][N]
Just call me Joshua, gorgeous.[A][N]
And no need for thanks, just[N]
doing my duty as a man.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hmm?[A][N]
Something on your mind?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
That soldier earlier mentioned[N]
you getting back to your station.[A][N]
Weren't you supposed to be[N]
fighting for them?[A][N]
Doesn't helping me sort of...[N]
conflict with your employment?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, I can't lie, it isn't ideal.[A][N]
But truth be told, I never cared[N]
much for this lot anyway.[A][N]
The wages are crap as well.[A][N]
I've gotten paid more cleaning[N]
toilets.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Heh.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hey, I finally got a smile[N]
out of you.[A][N]
I guess my luck is starting[N]
to look up.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Thank you again, Joshua.[A][N]
But I must be going now.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hey, uh, miss?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I don't know if you noticed, but this[N]
place is full of Grado soldiers.[A][N]
...So unless you're hiding a sword under[N]
that dress, I don't fancy your chances.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...[N]
Even so,[...] I must try![A][N]
People must learn what the Grado[N]
Empire is doing![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, personally it doesn't interest[N]
me one bit.[A][N]
But if a beautiful woman needs a hand,[N]
I'm honorbound to oblige.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Y-you mean?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
You bet!
I'm on your side now.[A][N]
I reckon I'll have way more fun[N]
tagging along with you anyhow.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][CloseEyes]
Oh thank you lord![A][N]
Your blessing is received[N]
gratefully.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well I ain't a lord, but I'll take[N]
the thanks all the same, miss... uh...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh! Forgive my manners[A][N]
I never introduced myself.[A][N]
My name is Natasha.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Natasha eh? A beautiful name[N]
to go with a beautiful face.[A][N]
Let's get going.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, let's.[A][X]

## Chapter_05_Scene_04_Convo_05
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace_Seth]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace_Eirika]
What was that about a cleric?[A][N]
She's a... traitor to the throne of Grado?[A][X]

## Chapter_05_Scene_04_Convo_06
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Eirika]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace_Natasha]
Ah...![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Are you alright?[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Wh-who are you?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm from Renais. Why are[N]
these Grado men after you?[A][N]
And for that matter, who are you[N]
sir? A friend of hers?[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace_Joshua]
A friend, yeah. I guess you[N]
could say that.[A][N]
Actually, think of me more[N]
as a bodyguard.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Please, travellers, you must[N]
listen to my words.[A][N]
I have something to tell you,[N]
it's about Grado--[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Wait-- soldiers are coming[N]
this way.[A][N]
We'll have to talk later.[A][N]
Stay close to us![A][X]
