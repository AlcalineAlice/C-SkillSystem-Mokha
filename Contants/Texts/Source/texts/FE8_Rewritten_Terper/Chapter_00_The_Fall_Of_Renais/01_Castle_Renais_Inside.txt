F-Father?[A][N]
What... what should I do?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Eirika, my dear child...[A][N]
Do you still have your sword[N]
and bracelet with you?[A][N]

Good.[A] ...Good.[A][N]

Your Majesty?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Please, take Eirika and head for Frelia.[A][N]
King Hayden is an honorable man.[A][N]

[OpenRight][LoadFace_Eirika]
Wh-?![A][N]
Father![A][N]
[OpenFarFarRight]
I understand.[A][N]
And what of Your Majesty?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I shall remain here.[A][N]
I thought I could trust Vigarde with my life,[N]
yet now, he attacks me?[A] My people?[A][N]
I... I must know why.[A][N]
Am I somehow responsible for this?[A][N]
Have I erred in my friendship,[N]
my leadership?[A][N]
Renais, Grado...[N]
Did I fail them both?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Father, you can't stay.[A] You mustn't![A][N]
If you do, then...!![A][N]

Vigarde...[A][N]
You have invaded my kingdom.[N]
Claimed the lives of my people.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_VigardeHealthy]
I have indeed.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Why?[A] No, don't bother.[A][N]
You'd trade our lives to attain[N]
our Stone.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
"Trade" is not the word I would use...[A][N]
But yes, I am here for your Stone.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Is this... is this all it was worth?[A][N]
The days we spent together,[N]
hunting, laughing, consoling...[A][N]
Is this all that was worth?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I will not spend words yet, my friend.[A][N]
All will be over soon.[A][N]
Now come, Fado.[A][N]
Let me test your sword, once more![A][N]

Vigarde...!![A][X]
