Princess Eirika![A] This way![A] I can[N]
see no more of Grado's men.[A][N]
If we've made it this far, we've[N]
surely earned a moment's rest.[A][N]
And... please forgive my grabbing you[N]
so... brusquely earlier.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
No, it's... it's of no concern, Seth.[A][N]
[MoveRight][OpenEyes]
S-Seth![A] Your wound.[A][N]
I-I'm so sorry, I didn't--[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Your Highness, I can't allow an injury[N]
like this to become an obstacle.[A][N]
We have more important matters to[N]
attend to.[A] We must press on to Frelia.[A][N]
We must fulfill his Majesty's wishes...[A][N]
But, take this moment to rest. And...[A][N]
At least until we reach safe haven, do[N]
not let your heart be clouded with grief.[A][N]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]
...Yes...[A][N]
Father is strong, he can protect everyone...[N]
everyone in the castle will be safe...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
And brother... no matter how bruised and[N]
battered he was from training...[A][N]
He'd always brush it off with a laugh...[A][N]
So... they are well.[A] They have to be.[A][N]
...[A].Lyon... why did your father do this...?[A][X]

Once we cross the bridge, we will[N]
be in Frelia, near Border Mulan.[A][N]
Let us hurry, Princess Eirika.[A][X]

Your Highness...[N]
This will not be an easy ride.[A][N]
Please, no matter what,[N]
if something should happen to me,[A][N]
you must continue to Frelia,[N]
alone if need be.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Seth... b-but I can't just...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Princess Eirika, your concern for me[N]
is touching.[A][N]
But I'm afraid this is non-negotiable.[A][N]
You must make it Frelia, no matter[N]
what happens to me.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
But I...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
If you wish to reunite with your father[N]
and brother it is imperative that you[A][N]
survive.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
Seth...[N]
So be it.[A][N]
I... will do as you wish.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
I can't believe I'm having to[N]
make these choices...[A][X]

Seth![A][N]
No with your wound, you...[A][N]
I refuse to leave.[N]
I will not lose anything else today![A][N]

Curse this wound![A][N]
Because of this, the princess will[N]

Princess...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Forgive me, Princess.[A][N]
My failure has taught you the pain[N]
of taking another person's life.[A][N]
My shame is...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
No, I will be fine.[A][N]
...Let us move on to Frelia, Seth.[A][N]

Princess...?[A][N]
Yes... of course, Princess.[A][X]
