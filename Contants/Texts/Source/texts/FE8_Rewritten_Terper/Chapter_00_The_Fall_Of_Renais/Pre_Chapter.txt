The castle gate has been breached,[N]
Your Majesty![A][N]
Emperor Vigarde's forces are within[N]
the castle walls![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I... I understand.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
The garrison has fallen...[A][N]
We've lost contact with Prince Ephraim...[A][N]
Your Majesty, what are we to do?![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
What else can we do?[A][N]
Order your men to lay[N]
down their arms and surrender.[A][X]

[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]
F-Father?[A][N]
What... what should I do?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Eirika, my dear child...[A][N]
Do you still have your sword[N]
and bracelet with you?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Yes... yes I have them both, but...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Good.[A] ...Good.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Seth.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Seth]
Your Majesty?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Please, take Eirika and head for Frelia.[A][N]
King Hayden is an honorable man.[A][N]
He will keep her safe.[A][N]
[OpenRight][LoadFace_Eirika]
Wh-?![A][N]
Father![A][N]
[OpenFarFarRight]
I understand.[A][N]
And what of Your Majesty?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I shall remain here.[A][N]
I thought I could trust Vigarde with my life,[N]
yet now, he attacks me?[A] My people?[A][N]
I... I must know why.[A][N]
Am I somehow responsible for this?[A][N]
Have I erred in my friendship,[N]
my leadership?[A][N]
Renais, Grado...[N]
Did I fail them both?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Father, you can't stay.[A] You mustn't![A][N]
If you do, then...!![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Even now I want to believe, Eirika.[A][N]
Seth, please![A] Take her to safety![A][N]
[OpenRight]
Father![A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Eirika]
Seth, no![A] Let me go![A] Father!![A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Please forgive me, Princess.[A][N]
My king...[A][N]
I swear to upload this duty,[A][N]
no matter what.[A][N]
Franze! With me![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
No... NO!!!![A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Fado]
Vigarde...[A][N]
You have invaded my kingdom.[N]
Claimed the lives of my people.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_VigardeHealthy]
I have indeed.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Why?[A] No, don't bother.[A][N]
You'd trade our lives to attain[N]
our Stone.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
"Trade" is not the word I would use...[A][N]
But yes, I am here for your Stone.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Is this... is this all it was worth?[A][N]
The days we spent together,[N]
hunting, laughing, consoling...[A][N]
Is this all that was worth?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I will not spend words yet, my friend.[A][N]
All will be over soon.[A][N]
Now come, Fado.[A][N]
Let me test your sword, once more![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Vigarde...!![A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Franz]
G-general Seth, what should I--[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Franz, ride ahead of us and bring[N]
word of our coming to Frelia.[A][N]
A single rider has better odds of passing[N]
unseen by Grado's men.[A][N]
Convey to the throne all that has happened[N]
here... and petition for reinforcements.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
U-understood![A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_EirikaClosed]
Seth..., please, Seth, I have to...[A][N]

Princess Eirika, I--[A][N]
Quick! Behind me![A][X]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace_Eirika]
Ah...![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Hahaha... tell me, would[N]
you be General Seth of Renais?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
What of it?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Well well, this must be my lucky day![A][N]
Another kill to add to my collection!![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Dastard![A][X]

## Chapter_00_Scene_02_Convo_04
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Seth]
Argh...![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
N-No![A][X]

## Chapter_00_Scene_02_Convo_05
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Valter][MoveMidLeft]
Oh...? He would abandon his honor,[N]
turn coward and run, for the sake of duty?[A][N]
Interesting![A][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_SoldierBrown]
General Valter! Are we to pursue?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Haha, no, that will do.[A][N]
I want to fight him again...[A][N]
His valor intrigues me.[A][N]
I will take great pleasure in[N]
crushing it.[A][N]
But as it stands, it would be as[N]
a lion, swatting away a cub.[A][N]
Besides, our princeling would be[N]
quite upset if I...[A][N]
Accidentally scarred the girl,[N]
don't you think?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Uh... yes, sir![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Besides, greater battles await us![A][N]
King Fado's son is still unaccounted for,[N]
so let us get to it![A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Sir![A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Seth]
Princess Eirika![A] This way![A] I can[N]
see no more of Grado's men.[A][N]
If we've made it this far, we've[N]
surely earned a moment's rest.[A][N]
And... please forgive my grabbing you[N]
so... brusquely earlier.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
No, it's... it's of no concern, Seth.[A][N]
[MoveRight][OpenEyes]
S-Seth![A] Your wound.[A][N]
I-I'm so sorry, I didn't--[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Your Highness, I can't allow an injury[N]
like this to become an obstacle.[A][N]
We have more important matters to[N]
attend to.[A] We must press on to Frelia.[A][N]
We must fulfill his Majesty's wishes...[A][N]
But, take this moment to rest. And...[A][N]
At least until we reach safe haven, do[N]
not let your heart be clouded with grief.[A][N]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]
...Yes...[A][N]
Father is strong, he can protect everyone...[N]
everyone in the castle will be safe...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
And brother... no matter how bruised and[N]
battered he was from training...[A][N]
He'd always brush it off with a laugh...[A][N]
So... they are well.[A] They have to be.[A][N]
...[A].Lyon... why did your father do this...?[A][X]

## Chapter_00_Scene_03_Convo_02
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Seth]
Once we cross the bridge, we will[N]
be in Frelia, near Border Mulan.[A][N]
Let us hurry, Princess Eirika.[A][X]

## Chapter_00_Scene_03_Convo_03
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Eirika]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Seth]
Your Highness...[N]
This will not be an easy ride.[A][N]
Please, no matter what,[N]
if something should happen to me,[A][N]
you must continue to Frelia,[N]
alone if need be.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Seth... b-but I can't just...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Princess Eirika, your concern for me[N]
is touching.[A][N]
But I'm afraid this is non-negotiable.[A][N]
You must make it Frelia, no matter[N]
what happens to me.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
But I...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
If you wish to reunite with your father[N]
and brother it is imperative that you[A][N]
survive.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Seth...[N]
So be it.[A][N]
I... will do as you wish.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[BoxType_InnerMonologue]
I can't believe I'm having to[N]
make these choices...[A][X]

Grado's men...[A][N]
Princess Eirika, hurry.[A][N]

[MoveFarLeft]
Hrgk![A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Seth![A][N]
No with your wound, you...[A][N]
I refuse to leave.[N]
I will not lose anything else today![A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft]
Princess...[A][N]
Curse this wound![A][N]
Because of this, the princess will[N]
will be forced to...[A][X]
