[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Neimi]
C-Colm...![A][N]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Colm]
What now?[A] I told you not to worry.[A][N]
I could've robbed those bandits blind[N]
on my own, thank you very much.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I was...[N]
worried...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
H-hold on![A] I'm sorry![A][N]
C'mon![A] Don't start bawling![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Aaah... *sniff*...[A][N]
No more... dangerous stuff...[N]
by yourself...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
F-fine, fine, I promise.[A][N]
But you have to stop crying[N]
all the time.[A] All right?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes]
Uh-huh...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]
Oh, yeah.[A] Take a[N]
look at this.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]
Huh?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
I got you your mother's mirror back.[A][N]
I knew those thugs had taken it.[A][N]
See what happens when you give[N]
me a job?[A] Guranteed results![A][N]
[OpenLeft][CloseEyes]
Colm...[A][N]
Aaah... waah...[N]
It's not as important...[A][N]
as you waaah... Colm...[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Hey? W-what are you[N]
crying about this time?[A][N]
C'mon! Stop! Knock it[N]
off! Please, Neimi...[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace_Seth]
...Hmph. This is quite touching, but...[A][N]
I think you'd best return Princess[N]
Eirika's bracelet to her now.[A][N]
...I'd rather not give Lady Neimi futher[N]
reason to cry.[A][N]
[OpenLeft][MoveFarRight]
[OpenRight][MoveLeft]
[OpenFarRight]
Huh?[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Wh-what are you talking about?[A][N]
Are you trying to say that I--[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft]
Whoa! Whoa there! Hands off the goods![A][N]
It's right here! Take it![A][N]
[MoveRight]
[OpenMidLeft]
.....[A][N]
Tell me, boy, is this the path[N]
you've chosen for your life?[A][N]
If this girl matters to you,[N]
you must quit this road.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Uh, yeah... right.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
We're leaving, do not expect[N]
to be rescued again.[A][N]
Farewell.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
...Hey, wait![A][N]
Let us go with you.[A][N] You[N]
can't just leave us here.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Pardon?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Neimi and I... we've got no home[N]
to return to.[A][N]
No matter where we go, there's[N]
just gonna be more fighting.[A][N]
You're mercenaries, right?[A][N]
Well, then take us with you.[A][N]
I'm a handy guy to have around.[A][N]
I know I can help you out.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Of course n--[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Of course you can.[A][N]
Our destination is dangerous, but[N]
we'll be glad to have you.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Awesome![A][N]
You just wait-- I promise you[N]
won't regret your decision.[A][X]

## Chapter_03_Scene_09_Convo_01
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Eirika]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Seth]
Here you are, Princess.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Thank you, Seth.[A][N]
I swear to you, I will not lose it again.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
.....[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Seth...?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Forgive me, Highness.[A][N]
I nearly attempted to overrule[N]
your decision.[A][N]
It is my duty to follow your[N]
orders until my last, nothing more.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Don't be silly, Seth.[A][N]
Without your counsel, I would[N]
be left with nothing.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Your words honor me, Princess.[A][N]
...please excuse me, I must prepare[N]
for our departure.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
...I hope that taking them along[N]
will go some way in making amends...[A][N]
[OpenFarFarRight]
Eeerriikkkkaaa!![A][N]
[MoveMidRight]
Eirika, dear![A][N]
How are you holding up?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Tana, I'm doing fine, thank you.[A][N]
And... thank you for your help in[N]
getting back my bracelet.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Not a problem![A][N]
But it must be really important[N]
to you, huh?[A][N]
It's pretty and all, but I though[N]
we had to hurry to Ephraim.[A][N]
Oh... yes, it is important.[A][N]
He... Father gave it to me...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
!! I-I'm sorry, Eirika,[N]
I didn't mean to...[A][N] I'm sorry.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
It's okay, Tana.[A]...[CloseEyes]Tana?[OpenEyes][A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, Eirika?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
These bandits we've killed...[A][N]
They were people of Renais,[N]
just like me.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...Do you feel guilty.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
.....[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...Eirika, sweetie.[A][N]
No matter where you're from[N]
or who you are...[A][N]
it's what you're doing that's[N]
important, right?[A][N]
How they ended up here is important[N]
but so is what they were doing![A][N]
Whoever they are, if they do bad things,[N]
you gotta stop them![A] Right?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
...![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
You did the right thing, Eirika.[A][N]
Believe me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Yes.[A] Thank you, Tana.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Hey, it's what I'm here for![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Heehee...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Huh? What's so funny?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
You sounded somewhat like[N]
Ephraim just now, Tana.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...Is that meant to be a[N]
compliment of an insult?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
A bit of this, a bit of that...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Why, you![A] Now we've gotta bring him home![A][N]
I'll show you I sound nothing like him![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
It's a promise.[A][X]

## Chapter_03_Scene_10_Convo_01
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace_Duessel]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace_Glen]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Selena]
General Duessel.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Selena. Have you been back long?[A][N]
Tell me, how fares the campaign[N]
in Renais?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Signs of chaos abound.[A][N]
Brigands ride without fear, and[N]
the peasants' cries fill the air.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
...[A][N]
If Grado's troops do not enforce public[N]
order, the situation will only worsen.[A][N]
And still, His Majesty has given us[N]
no orders.[A][N]
Perhaps, just this once, I should[N]
take the lead...[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Whst could His Majesty be thinking?![A][N]
Breaking our long-held alliance with[N]
Renais--invading without warning...[A][N]
He's never been this way before.[A][N]
He abhors violence.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
.....[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
And have you noticed the recent[N]
promotions? Who they are going to?[A][N]
Battle-hungry upstarts, not[N]
honorable men and women.[A][N]
Ever since he returned from Renais,[N]
he's been so... different...[A][N]
But even before that, the Emperor that[N]
I knew would never..![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Glen, it doesn't matter what any[N]
of us think of our orders.[A][N]
We are his servants, and we will not[N]
question His Majesty's intentions.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Tsk. I know that, Selena.[A][N]
But...[A][N]
Our own people have been whipped[N]
into a frenzy.[A][N]
You talk of enforcing order abroad,
Sir Duessel.[A][N]
But I say we need to do the same[N]
within our own borders first![A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]...[A]That's enough.[A][N]
His Majesty summons us.[A][N]
Let's hope we can learn a[N]
little during our audience.[A][X]

## Chapter_03_Scene_11_Convo_01
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_VigardeHealthy]
...I appreciate your work in[N]
fulfilling your previous orders.[A][N]
You are... the hammers that drive[N]
the nails of the empire's will...[A][N]
You will continue to operate[N]
...without hesistation...[A][N]
wherever I send you.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Duessel]
...By your command.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Selena]
In Your Majesty's name.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Glen]
Yes, sire...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...However, I know this...[A][N]
You, my Imperial Three, lack the strength[N]
to claim the Stones... on your own...[A][N]
I have chosen... three additional generals.[A][N]
They will join you... in what is to come.[A][N]
...Enter...[A][X]

## Chapter_03_Scene_11_Convo_02
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Vigarde]
...[N]
With the addition of these three...[A][N]
The empire will have six generals[N]
strong enough to claim the Stones.[A][N]
Do you understand?[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Riev]
Good afternoon...[A][N]
I am Bishop Riev, in the employ[N]
of His Majesty.[A][N]
You may have seen me scurry about[N]
the castle in the past, but...[A][N]
I believe I have not talked with[N]
any of you before. Pleasure.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Duessel]
..The pleasure is ours, Bishop.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Caellach]
'Sup?[A] I'm Caellach.[A] I used to be a mercenary,[N]
fighting in the desert.[A][N]
And I--...[A][N]
Well, you're a fine-lookin' lass, aren't you?[N]
Yeah, I'm gonna love working with you.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Selena]
...[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Valter]
Greetings![A] You know me as General[N]
Valter, but you will call me Moonstone.[A][N]
All I ask is that you don't intefere[N]
in my battles.[A] We wouldn't want any...[A][N]
accidents.[A][N]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace_Glen]
[MoveFarLeft]
Tsk...[A][N]
[OpenRight][LoadFace_Duessel]
We'll make sure not to, Moonstone.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_VigardeHealthy]
Selena, Caellach. ... You will[N]
being me Frelia's Stone.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Caellach]
[OpenRight][LoadFace_Selena]
Yes, sire.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Sure, good as done.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
Duessel... You are charged with[N]
the defense of the empire.[A][N]
...Riev, I wish for you to continue...[A][N]
...as you have, with your duties.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Duessel]
[OpenRight][LoadFace_Riev]
Of course... Your Majesty.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
By your command, Sire.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Valter]
And I?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Valter, Glen...[N]
I have other duties for you...[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Glen]
Yes, Your Majesty?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Renais has fallen, but their Stone[N]
still eludes us...[A][N]
Their Prince Ephraim... still leads[N]
resistance within our borders.[A][N]
Capture him... and make him reveal...[A][N]
its whereabouts.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Ha ha! At once![A] You needn't worry,[N]
General Glen.[A][N]
I can take care of this assignment[N]
on my own.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight]
.....[A][N]
I'll think about it.[A][X]
