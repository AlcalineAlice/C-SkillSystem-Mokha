Um... is there anything I can do[N]
to help?[A] I feel so...[N]
When I was little I used to go[N]
hunting with my grandfather.[A][N]
What I mean is I can--[N]
I'm not bad with a bow.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Really?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Uh-huh.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I see.[A][N]
Then please, cover[N]
our advance.[A][X]

## Chapter_03_Scene_03_Convo_02
Hm?[A] Not sure who's out there, but[N]
it looks like we've got guests...[A][N]
Let's give 'em a warm welcome, lads.[A][N]
You see a stranger, stick an axe in 'em![A][N]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Colm]
And here... we... go![A][N]
Hah![A] Not a soul saw me.[N]
These bandits are easy pickings.[A][N]
They're gonna regret messing with[N]
Neimi...[A][N]
I don't give a crap about Lark, but...[A][N]
You bastards made her cry.[A][N]
Let's see if I can't find that mirror...[A][N]
and snag some loot on the way.[A][N]

C-Colm...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
Woah, Neimi?![A][N]
What are you doing here?![A][N]
I told you to wait for me,[N]
didn't I?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I couldn't... it's too dangerous.[A][N]
C'mon, let's go home.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Neimi, we don't HAVE a home![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][CloseEyes]
Ah![A] Okay please, just...[N]
don't shout...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...Listen, just leave everything to me.[A][N]
I can take care of it in a flash, but I don't[N]
want you tagging along.[A][N]
You'll only hold me back.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
But... but...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Arrrgghhh...[N]
Oh, this is ridiculous.[A][N]
We'll talk later![A][N]
Just... don't leave my side, Neimi.[A][N]
Okay?[A][N]
I-- All right![A][N]

*Huff* *huff*, found 'em.[A][N]
So this is the base of those[N]
bandit scum.[A][N]

to our village.[A][X]

Hey lady, how've you been?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Ross?![A] What are you[N]
doing here?![A][N]
Does your father know[N]
you're here?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
.....[N][A]
I overheard your group were[N]
heading to the bandits' hideout.[A][N]
I followed behind.[A][N]
Don't worry, I can look out for[N]
myself, you don't need to baby me.[A][N]

[OpenMidLeft]
Please answer my second question.[A]
Does he know?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...[A] We're not safe in Ide.[A][N]
But he won't hear it.[A][N]
I left him a note,[N]
he knows where I am.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...given the circumstances, you
stay with us for now.[A][N]
But you aren't to leave our
side.[A] Promise?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
You've got a deal.[A][N]
I'll show you what I can do![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]

She looked like she was[N]
about to cry...[A][X]
