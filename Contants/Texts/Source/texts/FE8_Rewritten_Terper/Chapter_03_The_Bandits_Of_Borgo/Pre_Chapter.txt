The local villagers tell me that[N]
Bazba's bandits keep their lair nearby.[A][N]
A few of them saw a lad matching the[N]
description you gave of the bracelet thief.[A][N]
It seems a fair guess that the youth[N]
is one of the bandits.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Bandits... here in Renais...[A][N]
Burning villages... stealing from[N]
people with no fear of reprisal.[A][N]
I...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Princess?[A] Is something the matter?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...Father Moulder told me before, that...[A][N]
That some of these bandits are victims[N]
of this war, that they have no alternative.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Indeed.[A][N]
Though a mindset I cannot claim to know...[A][N]
There are those who would abandon their[N]
honor for the sake of survival.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...This is... our fault, is it not?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Princess?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Bandits or not... they are people of Renais.[A][N]
Our failings have cost them so much...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Princess, you must not think like that.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
But it's true, is it not?[A][N]
Kindhearted?[A] I've always been ignorant[N]
of those who have truly suffered.[A][N]
It's as Sir Garcia said.[A][N]
All I've been is...[N]
a faceless, uncaring noble.[A][N]
I'm... despicable.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...!![A] Princess that simply isn't...[N]
That is not true...![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
.....[A]
Forgive me Seth.[A] This is hardly the time.[A][N]
We must reclaim the bracelet.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...[N]
Yes, Princess.[A][N]

[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace_Neimi]
Uh... hello?[A][N]
[MoveFarLeft]
P-pardon me for asking...[A][N]
but are you some sort[N]
of... mercenar group?[A][N]
[MoveMidLeft]
[OpenRight]
...Why do you ask?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]
P-p-please you have to help[N]
Colm.[A] You have to![A][N]
I told him it was too dangerous,[N]
b-but... he wouldn't listen to me.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Please, you must calm yourself.[A] Start[N]
at the beginning, and speak slowly.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
A-all right... *sniff*...[A][N]
I'm Neimi.[A][N]
I'm from... I used to be from[N]
a village named Lark...[A][N]
But my village is gone...[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Gone?![A] Did Grado...?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
N-no, it was...[N]
Bazba's Bandits burned it down.[A][N]
Only Colm and I escaped.[A][N]
The other villagers...[A][N]
The bandits attacked them,[N]
and... and...[A] Th-they...sniff...aaah...[A][N]
[OpenRight]
.....[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
...We understand.[A] If it is difficult,[N]
then please, say no more, Lady Neimi.[A][N]
But what are you doing here?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Bazba's Bandits... they have a[N]
hideout here in these mountains.[A][N]
That's where Colm...[A][N]
Um, Colm my... uh... we;ve known[N]
each other since we were kids.[A][N]
He went to steal back something[N]
the bandits took from me...[A][N]
[OpenRight]
He went alone...?[A][N]
But that's...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Y-yes, I know.[A] Th-that's what I told[N]
him, but he wouldn't listen to me.[A][N]
I-if I lose Colm, too, then I-I don't know...[A][N]
How I'm supposed... *sniff*...[A][N]
[OpenRight]
P-please, do not cry.[A][N]
We'll find your friend[N]
and see that he's not harmed.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Really?[A] Really and truly?[A][N]
Oh, thank you! Thank you!![A][N]
...I don't have much money,[N]
but I'll do anything to help![A][N]
[OpenRight]
We're searching for a thief.[A][N]
If the theif we're after has gone[N]
to the bandits' lair as well...[A][N]
Well it seems as though we share[N]
a common cause with you.[A][N]
But I... I regret that we weren't here to[N]
protect your friends and neighbours...[A][N]
Please forgive me, Neimi.[A][N]
N-No![A] Please don't apologize![A][N]
It's not your fault![A] It's those b-bandits.[A][N]
You haven't done anything wrong![A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
...Neimi, I trust[N]
you can lead the way?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Er, yes...[N]
It's this way.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]

...I wish I could believe that.[A][X]
