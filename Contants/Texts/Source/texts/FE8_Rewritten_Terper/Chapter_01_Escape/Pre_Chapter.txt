[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Tana]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_SoldierBlue]
Princess Tana![A] Grado's[N]
forces are approaching![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
What?![A] So soon?[A][N]
Ah, we've had no time![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Milady, we lack the arms to defend this[N]
castle.[A] You must return to Castle Frelia![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I can't, not yet![A] We haven't found[N]
Eirika and her companions yet.[A][N]
Eirika is my friend, and she needs[N]
my help.[A] I won't abandon her.[A][N]
Oh, I know![A] Go and ask Father--[N]
I mean King Hayden for more troops![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, Your Highness![A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
Eirika... please, please be safe...[A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Breguet]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_SoldierBrown]
Commander Breguet, the enemy appears to[N]
be fortifying its position in the castle.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Hmph![A][N]
They're tenacious, but they have[N]
no hope of stopping our advance![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
What are your orders, sir?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Ha![A] Orders?[A] You just stand here and[N]
watch.[A] I'll crush them myself![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Sir![A][X]

## Chapter_01_Scene_02_Convo_02
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Breguet]
Ha![A] That's what happens[N]
when you face my lance.[A][X]

## Chapter_01_Scene_03_Convo_01
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Breguet]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Tana]
St-stop right there![A][N]
Call off your forces and turn back,[N]
or you'll have me to deal with![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh?[A] Is that so?[A][N]
And who might you be?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Who--?[A] I am Tana; Princess[N]
of Frelia![A][N]
I will not permit you to abuse[N]
my country any longer![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Frelia's royal brat, huh?[A][N]
How convinient![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Leave this castle immediately![A][N]
If you harm me, my father and brother[N]
will chase you to the earth's end![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, I've heard how King Hayden dotes[N]
on his precious daughter.[A][N]
Let's see how true that is.[A] You'll[N]
make us a fine hostage, my dear.[A][N]
Seize the girl and lock her up![A][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_SoldierBrown]
Right away, sir![A][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
No! Let me go!![A][X]

## Chapter_01_Scene_04_Convo_01
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Seth]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Eirika]
Seth, look![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I see it.[A] It seems like Grado's[N]
army has already reached Frelia...[A][N]
Princess, this place is too preilous.[A][N]
We should bypass Mulan altogether and[N]
head straight to Frelia Castle.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I cannot just ignore this...![A][N]
I cannot allow Grado to do to Frelia[N]
what they've done to Renais![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Please, Seth![A][N]
I don't want to see any more people[N]
harmed by Grado's atrocities.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Princess, my wounds are yet to heal.[A][N]
Even if we drive away this small squad,[A][N]
Grado are likely to retake[N]
this land after we leave.[A][N]
And... you would have to take up arms,[N]
take more lives.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
... I know.[A] But still, I...[A][N]
I want to help where I can.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Your wish is my command, Princess.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Thank you, Seth![A][X]
