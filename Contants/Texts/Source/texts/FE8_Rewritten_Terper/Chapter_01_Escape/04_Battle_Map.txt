Seth, look![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I see it.[A] It seems like Grado's[N]
army has already reached Frelia...[A][N]
Princess, this place is too preilous.[A][N]
We should bypass Mulan altogether and[N]
head straight to Frelia Castle.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I cannot just ignore this...![A][N]
I cannot allow Grado to do to Frelia[N]
what they've done to Renais![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Please, Seth![A][N]
I don't want to see any more people[N]
harmed by Grado's atrocities.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Princess, my wounds are yet to heal.[A][N]
Even if we drive away this small squad,[A][N]
Grado are likely to retake[N]
this land after we leave.[A][N]
And... you would have to take up arms,[N]
take more lives.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
... I know.[A] But still, I...[A][N]
I want to help where I can.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Your wish is my command, Princess.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Thank you, Seth![A][X]
