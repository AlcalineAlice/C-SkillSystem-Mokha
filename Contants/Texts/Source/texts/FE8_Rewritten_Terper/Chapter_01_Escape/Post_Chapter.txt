Princess Tana.[N][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Sir Gilliam![A][N]
I'm sorry... I never meant[N]
to cause you trouble.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
It was no trouble.[A] I live[N]
to serve, Princess.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Thank you so much,[N]
Sir Gilliam.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarFarRight][MoveMidRight]
Tana...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...!![A] Eirika?![A][N]
Is that really you?[A][N]
[MoveRight]
[OpenMidRight]
Tana, why are you here?[A][N]
So far from Castle Frelia?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Why do you think?![A][N]
I was so, so worried about you![A][N]
Oh, I'm so glad that[N]
you're safe.[A][N]
But... where is Ephraim?[A][N]
...!![A] He... he didn't---![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
No, no Tana! He's okay![A][N]
...He must be.[A] He always is, right?[A][N]
I just... wish I knew where.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Oh, Eirika.[A][N]
Come, we must hurry to Castle Frelia![A][N]
My lord father may know something[N]
of his whereabouts.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Thank you, Tana...[A][N]
[OpenRight][MoveMidLeft]
And, Eirika...[A][N]
I'm really happy to see you again.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
... Me too.[A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Tana]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Hayden]
Oh, Tana![A] I'm so glad to see that[N]
you're safe and home again![A][N]
You are not to leave again without my[N]
permission.[A] Do you understand?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Don't be mad, Father.[A] Look![A][N]
I come bearing good news.[A][N]
Eirika![A]
[OpenRight][LoadFace_Eirika]
King Hayden...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Eirika![A] It does my heart[N]
good to see you safe.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Thank you.[A] Father sent me away[N]
with General Seth.[A][N]
But I'm not sure if my father...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Ah, yes...[A][N]
I... have received[N]
word of your father.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
! Is he... is he well?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...My friend King Fado...[A][N]
did not survive the fall of Renais Castle.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
E-Eirika...[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Seth]
...[A][N]
Thank you for bringing us this[N]
information, Your Majesty.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Rest assured, Grado will be punished for[N]
this cowardly act.[A] This is Frelia's promise.[A][N]
Eirika, please stay here and rest.[A] I can[N]
only imagine how exhausted you must be.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
.....[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Your Majesty, forgive my interruption.[A][N]
You must also know of Prince Ephraim's[N]
disappearance, do you not?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Ah yes.[A] We've heard that the prince and his[N]
men have evaded Grado at every turn.[A][N]
He engages small contingents where he[N]
can and quickly retreats into the shadows.[A][N]
Reports suggest he's crossed the[N]
border and now fights in Renvall.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
...My brother...[N]
He's in Grado itself?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes.[A] My pegasus knights brought[N]
this information at a great price.[A][N]
He truly is his father's son.[N]
But I fear for him.[A][N]
His desire to lash out at Grado is[N]
understandable.[A][N]
But it could cost him greatly.[A][N]
Would that I knew whether he[N]
remains unharmed, but I do not.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
I see.[A] Thank you for your hospitality,[N]
Your Majesty, but...[A][N]
I intend to ride to my brother's[N]
side with reinforcements.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
What?[A] No, I cannot allow it.[A][N]
I would be betraying Fado's memory[N]
if I allowed any harm to befall you.[A][N]
Stay here.[A] Rest and mourn.[A] Leave[N]
this war to the warriors.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
No, Your Majesty.[A][N]
My twin brother is in peril.[A][N]
My brother, he is a part of me...[A][N]
I cannot rest here in peace while[N]
he risks his life.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Renais is now a victim of[N]
Grado's occupation.[A][N]
Her armies are dust, she has no[N]
more to offer you.[A][N]
I wish that Frelia could provide you[N]
with support, with soldiers, but...[N][A]
My son, Innes, is on his way to[N]
meet the empire's forces.[A][N]
We cannot spare a single brigade.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
I will go alone, if I must.[A][N]
...With apologies.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
.....[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...*Sigh*...[N]
As resolute as your father, eh?[A][N]
What am I to do in the face of[N]
such determination?[A][N]
Very well, Princess Eirika.[A][N]
I will see what aid I can muster.[A][N]
But please, at least for tonight...[N]
allow your wounds to heal.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Yes![A] Thank you, Your Majesty.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Tana]
Father?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Tana, my dear.[A][N]
Was there something else?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes...[A][N]
Though you don't wish to hear it.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
No.[A][N]
I will not allow you to go with Eirika.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
But why?![A][N]
You allow my brother to lead![A][N]
Am I simply to sit here, while[N]
you send away my best friend?![A][N]
While she's suffering so![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Say what you will, Tana.[A][N]
You will remain here, and I[N]
will broker no altenative.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Then I WILL say what I will![A][N]
Father, you... you...![A][N]
You stubborn old dotard![A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
Tana![A] You will not speak to[N]
me in such a w--[A][N]
... *sigh*.[A]
[ClearFace][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Messenger]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Hayden]
That will be all.[A][N]
Dismissed.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, Your Majesty![A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenFarFarRight]
Your Majesty![A][N]
General Seth of Renais[N]
wishes an audience.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Send him in.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Seth]
Greetings, Your Majesty.[A][N]
Allow me to once again thank you[N]
for your generosity.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Think nothing of it, my boy.[A][N]
I only regret that I cannot do more.[A][N]
How is your injury?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Father Moulder has looked at it,[N]
and it has closed up.[A][N]
I thank you, Highness.[A][N]
But... it is not physical wounds[N]
that are on my mind.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Ah, yes...[A][N]
To think that I can never again[N]
meet with Fado.[A][N]
I had always thought the old coot[N]
would outlive me.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
You were close friends.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
In our youth, we were very similar[N]
to how our own boys are now, yes.[A][N]
...Along with the then[N]
Prince of Grado, Vigarde.[A][N]
Oh the times we had together,[N]
I considered them both as brothers.[A][N]
Which makes the pain of Vigarde's[N]
betrayal all the more disheartening...[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
And yet the pain I feel is naught[N]
compared to young Eirika's.[A][N]
To lose both her father and her[N]
kingdom in the same day.[A][N]
How is she faring?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
I... I must be frank, Your Majesty.[A][N]
I do not know.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
What?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Ever since we left the castle,[N]
and even now...[A][N]
Her Highness has shed not even[N]
one tear.[A][N]
She has resolutely locked her eyes[N]
in front of her and kept pushing on.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
It sounds like she is[N]
of strong conviction.[A][N]
But you worry?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
I do, Your Majesty.[A][N]
I believe she is carrying all her[N]
grief alone, refusing to let it show.[A][N]
Her father's life has been claimed...[N]
and she has killed to protect her own.[A][N]
I fear that carrying such a burden alone...[N]
will cause her great suffering.[A][N]
And so, while it pains me to ask[N]
even more of you, Your Majesty...[A][N]
Please... allow Princess Tana[N]
to join us.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
I am unable to give Princess Eirika[N]
the comfort she needs.[A][N]
My station forbids me from being the[N]
friend she is deserved.[A][N]
But Princess Tana...[N]
she can speak the words I cannot.[A][N]
Heal the wounds that no magic[N]
can touch.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
I know that this is much to ask,[N]
Your Majesty.[A] Too much.[A][N]
But... to allow Princess Eirika to[N]
suffer so... I cannot.[A][N]
I have vowed to let no harm come[N]
to her, Your Majesty.[A][N]
All I can do right now, is to[N]
vow the same of your daughter.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...[A][N]
...Dotard, eh?[A] Maybe...[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
...?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps it is time to let the[N]
young rise up.[A][N]
What do you think...[N]
Fado?[A] ...Vigarde?[A][X]

[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Seth]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Hayden]
I cannot persuade you to[N]
stay even one more night?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Forgive me, Your Majesty, but[N]
we cannot tarry a moment longer.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
It is nothing to apologize for.[A][N]
To see you hold such strong conviction,[N]
how could I possibly stop you?[A][N]
But first...[A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
Gilliam, Moulder.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Moulder]
[OpenRight][LoadFace_Gilliam]
Your Majesty.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
The two of you are to escort[N]
Princess Eirika.[A][N]
Be her shield and heal her wounds.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Understood.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Of course, Your Majesty.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
And... Tana.[A][N]
[OpenRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Tana]
...Yes, Father?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...You, too, are to accompany her.[A][N]
Support her in the way only[N]
you can, Tana.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
!! Yes, Father!![A][N]
Thank you so much!![A] I love you![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hrm.[A] Yes, yes.[A][N]
[OpenRight][LoadFace_Eirika]
A-are you certain, Your Majesty?[A][N]
I-I'm grateful, but...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Fear not.[A] If-- when she causes trouble,[N]
do feel free to send her home.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Father!![A][N]
[OpenRight]
Hahaha...[N]
Thank you, Your Majesty.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
In addition to these three,[A][N]
I have also prepared some gold[N]
as well as a wagon.[A][N]
And with that, Princess Eirika...[N]
may the Stones bless you on your way.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Thank you... thank you for everything,[N]
Your Majesty.[A] I am forever in your debt.[A][X]
