Why?![A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]

Not that you religious types would[N]
know much about that.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Artur]

What?[A][N]
Do you need a minute to[N]
catch your breath?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Seth]
A battlefield does not[N]
permit such luxury.[A][N]
And I will not invite death[N]
by accepting an enemy's grace.[A][N]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Tirado]

fedual monarch all are equal in death.[A][N]
