Seth has mapped out a route for us.[A][N]
We'll travel south of Renais and pass[N]
through Serafew into Grado territory.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Hmm...[N]
That would seem a sensible plan.[A][N]
Assuming, of course, that we avoid[N]
any run-ins with Grado soldiers.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Sounds good to me![A][N]
Eirika, should I scout ahead[N]
a bit?[A][N]
From up there, I'll have a better chance[N]
of spotting any nearby enemies![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Are you certain?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Yes, Eirika, I'm quite certain![A][N]
I will sit in the castle and[N]
twiddle my thumbs no longer.[A][N]
Trust me, this arrangement is far more[N]
to my benefit than yours, already.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
That's not true at all, Tana.[A][N]
But, thank you.[A] Truly.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
I am quite inclined to agree with[N]
Princess Tana.[A][N]
She could stand to do with a bit[N]
of military discipline.[A][N]
Why, during my last sermon, her[N]
snoring almost brought the roof down![A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Father Moulder![A][N]
I-I do not SNORE![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hahaha....[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Don't laugh, Eirika![A][N]
Ugh, you two are awful![A][N]
I'm going to go scout![A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
...I'm glad she hasn't changed.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Hahaha...[A][N]
I may complain at times, but...[A][N]
I sometimes feel that Princess Tana...[A][N]
Well she may be the only one who[N]
truly understands my teachings.[A][N]
Her heart remains where it's always been.[A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Bone]
Hey, boss![A] We've found more[N]
villages ripe for the picking![A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace_Bazba]One, two, three...[N]
Ha ha ha![A] I love a good war![A][N]
God knows why Grado is doing[N]
this, but who cares?[A][N]
With all these soldiers preoccupied,[N]
we're free to pillage as we please![A][N]
Right, Bone-- you're in charge.[A][N]
Grab everything that's not nailed[N]
down and bring it to the hideout.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm on it![A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Ross]
Dad![A][N]
Bandits approaching![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Hmph![A][N]
I'm getting you out of here,[N]
Ross.[A] Stay close to me![A][X]

## Chapter_02_Scene_04_Convo_01
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Bone]
Let's start with that there village![A][N]
Get to it, boys![A] It's all yours.[A][N]
Cut down anyone who's dumb enough to get[N]
in your way![A][N]
I'm heading 'round the[N]
mountains to the other villages.[A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Garcia]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Ross]
Unnggh!![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Ross?![A] What is it?[A][N]
What's wrong?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
It's nothing![A] It's just a scratch![A][N]
You're a warrior, Dad, and I am your[N]
son.[A] I won't be beaten so easily.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Don't risk yourself so foolishly, boy![A][N]
We need to get you some help.[A][N]
Please![A] Someone help my son![A][X]

## Chapter_02_Scene_06_Convo_01
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace_Tana]
Wh-woah![A] This looks intense![A][N]
I have to get back to[N]
Eirika at once![A][X]

Eirika![A][N]
The village to the east is[N]
under attack by bandits.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Bandits...?[A][N]
But why?[A] Their homeland is[N]
at war, why pillage it further?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Moulder]
It is because this is war[N]
that they act, Princess Eirika.[A][N]
Perhaps there are those among them[N]
who are truly villains in spirit...[A][N]
But there may well be those who[N]
have lost everything in recent times.[A][N]
For them, brigandry may be the only[N]
option they see available.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...I see.[A][N]
But no matter their motives, I cannot[N]
allow these innocent people to suffer![A][N]
We have to drive them off![A][N]
[OpenRight]
I'm with you![A][N]
And... I saw someone injured.[A][N]
I think he was just a little child...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
![A] Father Moulder, can[N]
your staff heal him?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Well, yes, I can heal his[N]
injuries with my staff, but...[A][N]
I cannot do it from here.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
That's fine![A] Leave this to me.[A][N]
I'll bring him here![A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Moulder]
Please be careful, Princess.[A][N]
Were anything to happen to you, then...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Then my father would[N]
have your head, yes.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
P-Princess![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm just joking, Father Moulder![A][N]
You needn't worry, I'll be fine![A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
Sometimes, I really wonder...[A][X]
