Castle Renvall.[A][N]
He's supposed to be an old friend[N]
of General Valter.[A][N]
You should be careful.[A][N]
... Huh? Why am I[N]
warning you?[A][N]
Listen, pal, you try living with[N]
taxes like these.[A][N]
It's enough to make you want[N]

Thank you for coming all this way.[A][N]
Don't worry-- we all[N]
have your back.[A][N]
There is not a soul here who[N]
would sell you out.[A][N]
Please, be rid of those two[N]
monsters in the castle.[A][N]
They have made life a[N]
living hell for us.[A][N]
I believe in you![A][X]
