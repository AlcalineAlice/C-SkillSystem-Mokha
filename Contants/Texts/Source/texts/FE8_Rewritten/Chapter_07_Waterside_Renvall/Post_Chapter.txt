We've finally done it.[A][N]
Ephraim awaits inside.[N]
Are you ready, Seth?[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Of cou--[A][N]
Hold.[A][N][MoveRight]
Lady Eirika I can hear someone[N]
approaching...[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Don't worry, Seth.[N]

Princess Eirika! And...[N]
is that you, Seth?![A][N]
Oh thank the Heavens...[A][N]
Thank the Heavens you're alright.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Sir Orson![A][N]
It is good to see you, sir.[A][N]
I truly thought we had[N]
lost you. But...[A][N]
Why are you here? Where is[N]
Prince Ephraim?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I was out searching for him[N]
just now.[A][N]
This is the way out, then?[A][N]
He must be held elsewhere...[A][N]

It is so good to see you again,[N]
Sir Orson.[A][N]
Seeing you well is like a weight[N]
lifted off my shoulders.[A][N]
We heard that you and my brother were[N]
captured by Grado.[A][N]
Did you manage to escape?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, Princess, I did.[A][N]
Prince Ephraim, Kyle, Forde and I were[N]
captured and held here.[A][N]
I only just now managed to[N]
escape my cell...[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Orson... are you well?[A][N]
Your face is so pale. Grado's men,[N]
what did they do to you?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
No... please, Princess.[A][N]
It is nothing compared to the[N]
pain you must have endured.[A][N]
To come all the way here...[N]
you have grown strong, Princes.[A][N]
But Lord Ephraim... I cannot say[N]
whether he's still unharmed.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Aah... I-I see.[A][N]
But... Ephraim is strong.[A][N]
I have faith in him.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...[A][N]
I see... yes,[N]
I agree.[A][N]
Come, let us see if we can find him.[A][N]
Quickly, before reinforcements arrive.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Thank you, Sir Orson![A][N]
