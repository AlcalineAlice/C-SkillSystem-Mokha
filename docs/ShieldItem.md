# Shield

The "Shield" is the second equippable item in c-skillsys, distinct from the "Weapon". It provides damage correction during battle.

The shield can be understood as a physical shield, but it can also be seen as a talisman. Each character can equip an item as a shield in addition to their weapon. The shield, like the weapon, will be consumed as the battle hits. Game designers can choose when the shield item durability is consumed in the following scenarios:

- When attacking
- When defending

Additionally, it can be set to consume the shield item only when a hit is not missed.
