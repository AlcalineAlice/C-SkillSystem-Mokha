1. Now ally characters is limited to no more than 51. You should also make sure the character index is also in limitation, otherwise he will fail to learn and equip skills.

2. Since move-path can display no more than 20 steps in vanilla, with the increase of unit's mobility, this limitation may cause risk of overflow and thus crush the game. If you get in error on move-path, you can directly remove it by FEB patch [designer config](../Patches/PATCH_DeignerConfig.txt)
