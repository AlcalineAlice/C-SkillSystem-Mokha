Frelia's stone... is in our possession.[N]
General Selena... thank you.[A][N]
We have also discovered... the way to[N]
access.. the Stone of Renais.[A][N]
Glen.[N]
Valter.[A][N]
Thanks to your efforts...[N]
we hold one half of the puzzle.[A][N]
It is regrettable that Tirado[N]
lost the twins...[A][N]
But that shall not deter us.[A][N]
Your next mission will be to locate...[N]
the Princess of Renais.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Glen]
Yes, Your Majesty...[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Valter]
Hmm, Eirika, eh?[N]
Pah, a mewling little run.[A][N]
...Still, Tirado's incompetence aside,[N]
she did manage to take Renvall.[A][N]
If only Tirado hadn't told me to leave[N]
everything to him.[A][N]
Perhaps I could have gotten[N]
a good look at her strength.[A][N]
Not to mention she should still have[N]
General Seth at her side.[A][N]
With him and the prince...[A][N]
I should find enough[N]
entertainment to be satisfied.[A][ClearFace][X]

Bishop Riev.[N]
We now have two of the Stones.[A][N]
Please proceed as you have...[N]
and report any new findings.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Riev]
Yes Majesty, as you will.[A][N]
Novala's death has pushed our[N]
progress back a tad, I'm afraid.[A][N]
I will personall see to the next[N]
field test.[A][N]
I will travel to the mountains[N]
near Carcino.[A][N]
May the Heavens bless you[N]
on your quest, Emperor.[A][X]

I want you to watch...[N]
our northeasten borders.[A][N]
Though we have little left to do...[N]
in Frelia, they may retaliate.[A][N]
[OpenMidright]
Yes, Emperor.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Selena]
[OpenMidLeft]
Selena. You have done well...[N]
in claiming Frelia's Stone.[A][N]
Remain in the capital...[N]
and rest.[A][N]
Soon... I will have[N]
new orders for you.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, Sire...[A][N]
But, regarding General Caellach.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Mhm, I am not surprised...[N]
by his behaviour.[A][N]
However, I did not promote[N]
him to General...[A][N]
Because of his good manners.[A][N]
I would have ordered him to claim[N]
Jehanna's... either way.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...Yes, Sire.[A][N]

Are you... certain about[N]
these rates, Joshua?[A][N]
I admit I don't know much about[N]
mercenary pay, but...[A][N]
Surely a man of your skill could[N]
ask for more than this?[A][N]
Not to mention these routes through[N]
the mountains you've given us...[A][N]
Truth be told, I didn't think you[N]
would join us on this.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yeah, just go ahead and drown a guy[N]
in questions. Where do I start?[A][N]
Well, I've traveled these roads before,[N]
with some colleagues.[A][N]
These routes are, as far as I know,[N]
the quickest way to Jehanna.[A][N]
As far as money goes, well...[N]
I have a personal interest in this.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Personal interest...[A][N]
I see, I won't pry.[A][N]
But still, the amount is...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well hey, if you're going to complain,[N]
feel free to pay me triple.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I-I didn't mean...![A][N]
Triple is a bit...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Haha. Normal rates, then.[A][N]

I need not remind you of the importance[N]
of this mission, Syrene.[A][N]
I trust in your abiities completely.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Thank you, Prince Innes.[A][N]
I swear on my honor as commander[N]
that I will succeed.[A][N]
Vanessa, you will be able to handle[N]
Prince Innes on your own, yes?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Of course.[A] I will do my[N]
utmost--[A][N]
...Pardon what did[N]
you say, Sister?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
I asked if you will be able to handle[N]
your mission.[A][N]
Why, what did you hear?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Oh.[N]
...No, nothing.[A][N]
Yes, or course I can handle it.[A][N]
I will do all in my power to protect[N]
His Highness and his friends.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
I'm glad to hear it.[A][N]
Please take care of her for me,[N]
won't you, Prince Innes?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hah! Of course![A][N]
Though our mission will[N]
be dangerous...[A][N]
As the Prince of Frelia, it is my duty[N]
to protect my subjects.[A][N]
I ensure you that I will not spare[N]
anyone who would harm her.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Heehee. I am glad to[N]
hear it.[A][N]
May the Stones bless you[N]
on your wau, Prince Inness.[A][N]

[OpenMidLeft]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Is something the matter, Prince Innes?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Nothing in particular,[N]
it's just that...[A][N]
It sometimes feels as though your sister[N]
talks past me.[A][N]
As if she's having a different[N]
conversation entirely.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...She can be a bit... difficult,[N]
at times...[A][N]
But she means no harm.[A][N]
I think.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hmm.[N]
Well, it is no matter.[A][N]
Vanessa.[A][N]
Eirika and her companions should[N]
arrive within a few hours.[A][N]
I will leave ahead of them and prepare[N]
the way forward through Carcino.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Understood.[A][N]
I will await them here and then guide[N]
them to your position?[A][N]
Correct?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Precisely.[A][N]
Quick on the uptake, as always,[N]
Vanessa.[A][N]
I will see you soon then.[A][N]
...Oh, but before that.[N]
Take this.[A][N]
If you find an oppurtunity, give it to Ta-[N]
...to Princess Eirika.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, sir![A][N]

Oh, these dainty sugar pastries![N]
They're delightfully scrumptious![A][N]
Flavorful without being overwhelming.[N]

[BoxType_InnerMonologue]
Could they be Princess Eirika's[N]
companions?[A][N]
From the way that woman is[N]
dressed, she's easily of high status.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Hello there![A][N]
Did no one teach you it's[N]
rude to stare?[A][N]
Even if you are starting at someone[N]
as illustrious as myself.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hm? Ah, greetings.[A][N]
Would you be friends of[N]
Lady Eirika?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Ah, yes! How wondrous![A][N]
The tales of our valiant battle against[N]
evil have already spread...![A][N]
Deep in the dark, unforgiving woods[N]
of Za'ha![A][N]
We fought side by side against[N]
the forces of evil![A][N]
But through the powe of camaraderie and[N]
justice, we prevailed![A][N]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Rennac]
Must you?[A][N][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Dozla]
Gwahaha! Sounds about right[N]
to my ears![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Y-Yes, I read that report.[A][N]
I am here to guide you to[N]
Prince Innes.[A][N]
...I assume you were[N]
sent ahead of the others?[A][N]
...But it truly is a[N]
shocking revelation.[A][N]
To think that a man such as[N]
Bishop Riev would raise the dead...[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Sent ahead? I'm afraid we don't[N]
quite understand what...[A][N]
...what...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Uh... ma'am?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
...what...what...[A][N]
WHAT?![A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
I'll sixth that "what", Lady L'Arachel![N]
Gwahaha![A][N]
[OpenRight]
This is no laughing matter![A][N]
Dozla, Rennac, come![N]
We ride to Grado![A][N]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Rennac]
We were just there[N]
a few days ago![A][N]
Now you want us to go BACK?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Of course! Justice demands it![N]
And we... we must seek answers![A][N]
First, we shall finish this snack,[N]
and then, we ride.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Dozla]
Gwahaha! Come, Rennac![N]
We run with the wind![A][N]
The first to drop is[N]
the first to lose![A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight]
...Yeah, I don't think so...[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
Huh...?[N]
Wait, but what about--[A][N]
Oh, they're already gone...[A][N]
But what about the mission...?[A][ClearFace][X]

Thank you, Vanessa.[A][N]
The truth is, we arrived a short while[N]
ago, but...[A][N]
We didn't want to interrupt[N]
your conversation.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh, you needn't have[N]
worried.[A][N]
They were your companions,[N]
were they not?[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
What? No, they were not.[A][N]
They did seem... familiar, but[N]
I can't say I remember from where.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Truly? But they told me you fought[N]
together in Za'ha Woods.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Oh![A][N]
Yes, now I remember.[N]
I wonder wh--[A][N]

Hold that thought.[A][N]

doesn't look friendly.[A][X]
