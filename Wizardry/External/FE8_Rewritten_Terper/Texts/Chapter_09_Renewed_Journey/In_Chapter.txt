[OpenMidLeft]
My, oh my... it's about time they left.[A][N]
I'm finally done getting ordered about[N]
without getting paid.[A][N]
Huh? Oh, don't mind me. Just talking[N]
to myself.[A][N]
Here, I want you to hold on to this[N]
for me. Don't tell anyone.[A][N]
Oh, and don't say a word about seeing me[N]
to that L'Arachel girl, all right? Deal?[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft]
Wh-what do you want?[N]
Gimme a break...[A][N]
Leave us out of this stupid war of yours![A][N]
We don't want anything to do with it![A][N]
Or... are you just another victim,[N]
like the rest of us here?[A][N]
Well, regardless... here.[A][N]
Take this, and go do something about[N]
all this fighting, will you?[A][X]

## Chapter_09_In_Scene_Ameila_Arrives
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Amelia]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_SoldierBrown]
Attention![A][N]
Carcino's mercenaries will arrest the[N]
princess of Renais shortly.[A][N]
Our duty here is nearly ended, and[N]
I expect no further hostilities.[A][N]
If you must fight, however, remember[N]
that the whole empire fights with you![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Um, Commander?[A][N]
What should I do?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Who are you?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Sir! I'm Amelia of Silvia, sir![A][N]
I'm new, I was only assigned to your command[N]
today. I want to fight for the empire![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I don't need your life story, fool! Recruits[N]
are in front! Grab a lance and move![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Sir, yes sir![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
This lance... stab the enemy.[A][N]
[CloseEyes][MoveMidRight]
Stab the enemy, kill the enemy.[N]
Stab the enemy, kill the enemy.[A][N]
[OpenEyes]
I am a citizen of Grado.[N]
It's my duty to fight.[A][N]
And I'll fight my best![A][X]

## Chapter_09_In_Scene_Ewan
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Ewan]
Heeeey![A][N]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Eirika]
What? A child?[A][N]
Please, you must run away from here![A][N]
I'm sorry, but our presence has[N]
attracted villains to this town.[A][N]
Your life is in danger here.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Lady, I'm ALWAYS in danger![A][N]
Heck, danger is my middle name![A][N]
But the point is, I'm here[N]
to help you out![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
You're...?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm Ewan, and I'm a mercenary![A][N]
The prince of Frelia contrated me[N]
and my friends![A][N]
Technically, I was supposed to sit this[N]
one out...[A][N]
But hey, adults, you know?[A][N]
They don't know what's good for 'em![A][N]
I'm a proper mage, and I can lob[N]
fireballs with the best![A][N]
Come on, I'll help you out here,[N]
and then let's head to Carcino![A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
Wait, but...[A][N]
...Well, I suppose it won't hurt[N]
to have another mage along.[A][N]
...I hope.[A][ClearFace][X]

## Chapter_09_In_Scene_Ameila_Eirika
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Amelia]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Eirika]
Who are you?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
What? What?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Are you from around here?[A][N]
You should find someplace to hide.[N]
These men are after me. It's not safe.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
But... But I'm...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm a Grado soldier. I'm here to[N]
stop the Princess of Renais...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Huh? You're with Grado?[A][N]
Well, you better get to safety anyway.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Wait.[A] What?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Please, lay down your arms.[N]
I have no wish to fight a child.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Is... is this a trick?[A][N]
Princess Eirika is supposed to be[N]
a cruel, conniving fiend.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I don't know what Grado's officers[N]
have been telling you...[A][N]
Well, our countries are at war, so I suppose[N]
they can say whatever they want.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Are you saying that isn't the truth?[A][N]
I'm... I'm not sure I believe you.[A][N]
...What will you do if I[N]
don't surrender?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Heh, I'll pray that you trip[N]
on a stone.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
I-I see.[A] You know...[A] You have a[N]
really pretty smile.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Oh, uh, thank you.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
It's calming, like General[N]
Duessel's.[A][N]
...He's been really opposed to[N]
this war you know?[A][N]
Since the beginning.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]
...He doesn't smile anymore.[A][N]
[OpenEyes]
And now, I look at you, and[N]
you look as hurt as he does.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][HalfCloseEyes]
...I surrender, Princess Eirika.[A][N]
I don't want to fight you either.[A][N]
I want-- I need to understand[N]
why this war was started.[A][N]
To see the truth with my[N]
own eyes.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...I see.[A][N]
So... does that mean you're coming with us?[A][N]
I suppose I should ask for your name then.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Amelia. Amelia of Silva.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
She's just like Ross...[N]
Forced to wage war to protect herself.[A][X]

## Chapter_09_In_Scene_Ameila_Franz
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Amelia]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Franz]
Oh, who are you?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
What? What?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Are you one of the locals? This is[N]
a dangerous spot. You should hide.[A][N]
Here, come with me.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
But... But I'm...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm Franz, a Knight of Renais.[A][N]
What's your name?[A][N]
What are you doing here?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I-I'm Amelia.[A][N]
I'm... actually, I'm a Grado soldier.[A][N]
I'm supposed to be fighting you.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Really?[A][N]
So, uh, you're my enemy?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...I guess...[A][N]
Are you...[A][N]
Are you going to make[N]
me your prisoner?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Haha, no. I wouldn't do that.[A][N]
But... this is a problem.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
What should we do?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
First of all, you must listen to[N]
me and do as I say.[A][N]
We'll talk to Princesss Eirika later.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
What? NO![A][N]
My commander's told me Eirika's a[N]
cruel and merciless field who--[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh, that's utter nonsense.[A][N]
I've never heard the princess[N]
utter an unkind word to anyone.[A][N]
I understand why you're frightened.[N]
You think we're the enemy.[A][N]
But if we thought the same, I wouldn't[N]
be stopping to chat, eh?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I-I guess?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Besides, I'd hate to make an[N]
enemy of such a cute girl.[A][N]
Can I ask you to trust me[N]
for now, Amelia?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Mm...[A][N]
Well, all right.[N]
I'll trust you, Franz.[A][X]
