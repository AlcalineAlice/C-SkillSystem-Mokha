Sir Gilliam, is that Mulan? Have[N]
we reached Frelia's border already?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Aye, we have. Her Highness Princess[N]
Tana should be inside the castle.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
But look-- the countryside is[N]
crawling with Grado soldiers![A][N]
Where's the castle guard?[A] Has[N]
Mulan fallen? Are we too late?![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Too tough to say from here.[A][N]
Princess Tana's in no danger if[N]
they want her as a bargaining tool.[A][N]
We men of the Eastern Watch will[N]
see her to safety.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, of course![A][N]
We mustn't give up! We must move![A][N]
We must retake the castle, then, we[N]
ride forth to Princess Eirika's aid![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Easy there, lad.[A][N]
I've stronger armor than you do.[N]
I'll take the lead. Watch my back.[A][X]

Franz! I'm relived[N]
to see you're still in one piece.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Y-Yes...![A] And you as well, General--[A][N]
G-General! You're bleeding![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Mhm. I took an attack from an enemy...[N]
but that is of no import.[A][N]
Any wounds we knights sustain...[A][N]
are nothing compared to the[N]
Princess's pain.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
General...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Now come, Franz.[A][N]
Let us be rid of these[N]
dishonorable louts![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, sir![A][X]

Princess Eirika! It is so good[N]
to see that you are well![A][N]

Franz! You made it through unscathed...[A][N]
Thank goodness...[A][N]
So reinforcements are on the way?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Y-yes, Your Highness![A][N]
I met up with Sir Gilliam on the way[N]
and explained the situation in Renais.[A][N]
He was already on his way here to aid[N]
Princess Tana in her search for you.[A][N]
We rode as swiftly as we could.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Tana is here?![A][N]
Franz, we must hurry![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
U-Understood![A][X]

P-please, we're simple villagers,[N]
we don't have anything![A][N]
...Hm? You're... not with Grado?[A][N]
You're here to drive them out?![N]
Oh, thank the Stones...[A][N]
My family's been terrified[N]
ever since they arrived![A][N]
I beg you, king lordlings,[N]
don't fight near our house![A][X]

What the hell is the castle up to?![A][N]
Why pay them taxes if they can't even[N]
do the job they're here for?![A][N]
They've had weeks to prepare since[N]
we first heard that Renais was invaded![A][N]
Where's the King's army?![A][X]
