[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Ephraim]
Haaaahh... haaaahhh...[A][N]
What the hell is going on?[A][N]
[OpenRight][LoadFace_Forde]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Kyle]
Prince Ephraim... I hear sounds from[N]
down the corridor.[A][N]
Is there a fight going on...?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Seriously?! Oh wow... do you think[N]
they could be our way out of here?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...We're injured and unarmed.[A][N]
Well, not accounting for what little[N]
we could steal on the way up.[A][N]
If nothing else, their fighting[N]
may give us cover to flee.[A][N]
...Ugh...[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Careful, Prince Ephraim.[A][N]
You only just woke up.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Seriously though, what was[N]
in that food?[A][N]
And then when we wake up,[N]
the cell's open and no one's around![A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
...[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Kyle? Do you know something?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
I... when I woke up, I had[N]
this piece of paper in my hand.[A][N]
But it's...[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Wait, seriously? Is there something[N]
written on it? Come on, read![A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Y-yes, well...[A][N]
Ahem...[A][N]
"Good morning! I trust you had a[N]
restful sleep?[A][N]
Think of this as a little gift[N]
from one soldier to another.[A][N]
Please do not waste this chance[N]
I'm giving you! And make sure to..."[A][N]
Umm...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Well?[A][N]
Out with it, man.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
"Make sure to fatten up,[N]
my little piggy."[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Bastard...[A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Eirika]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Ephraim]
[OpenMidRight]
B-Brother! It's really... really you![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Eirika?! What are... how did you...?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh brother, I can't believe this day[N]
has actually come![A][N]
I-I'm so happy, I...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Of-of course I'm happy too, but...[A][N]
How did you end up here?[A][N]
WHY are you here?![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
To save you, of course, dear brother![A][N]
But let us talk more once we've routed[N]
the enemy.[A][N]
We will have plenty of time[N]
to catch up then![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
... ...[A][X]

## Chapter_08_In_Scene_Seth_Kyle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Seth]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Kyle]
General Seth![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well met, Kyle.[A][N]
I never thought for a moment that[N]
you could be bested easily.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
No, sir! And I never doubted[N]
that I would see you again.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Kyle.[N]
About Orson...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Orson? What of him?[A][N]
He was with us, but he was taken[N]
elsewhere after a while.[A][N]
Did you meet up with him[N]
already?[A][N]
He is still here, then?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...We will talk more[N]
on this matter later.[A][N]
We must direct our attention[N]
to the enemy right now.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, sir![A][X]

## Chapter_08_In_Scene_Forde_Franz
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Forde]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Franz]
Brother![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Ha! Franz![N]
How've you been?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I should ask you![A][N]
We'd heard you were captured[N]
by Grado's men. I was so worried.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Worried? I ride with Prince Ephraim,[N]
little brother.[A][N]
Death will have a tough time catching[N]
anyone who rides with our prince![A][N]
But it's not like we've avoided[N]
trouble altogether, that's for sure.[A][N]
Hm, have you grown taller than me?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I have. I've also finished my training.[A][N]
I'm now a sworn knight of Renais![A][N]
ou just watch-- I'm going to be on par[N]
with General Seth one day![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
You want to be like the general, eh?[A][N]
...What about me?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...[A] I still want to be[N]
like you, too, Brother![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
I didn't like that pause.[A][N]
I better start hitting the barracks[N]
more often when we get home.[A][X]
