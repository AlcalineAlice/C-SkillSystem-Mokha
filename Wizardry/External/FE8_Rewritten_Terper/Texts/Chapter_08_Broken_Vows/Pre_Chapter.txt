This way, Princess.[A][N]
The cells were this way.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
...?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Princess?[A][N]
Is something the matter?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Well... I just thought[N]
it was strange.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Strange?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
You said you were held in[N]
the deepest cells, weren't you?[A][N]
Then why did you[N]
come up here?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Pardon?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
If you were held in the same[N]
area that you think Ephraim is...[A][N]
Why did you come search for him[N]
up here, near the entrance?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_OrsonUnwell]
I... you're right Princess...[N]
why did I...?[A][N]
I fear that my time in the[N]
cell has left me delirious.[A][N]
I was wounded prior to being[N]
captured, and...[A][N]
It may have become infected[N]
I feel... quite ill.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Oh no... we have[N]
clerics with us.[A][N]
Please, Sir Orson.[A][N]
Stay here and recuperate.[A][N]
I'm sure we can find Ephraim[N]
as long as we search the dungeons.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOrson_Healthy]
I-I simply cannot allow that.[A][N]
I am the one who failed to protect[N]
your brother. I must make amends.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Sir Orson, please...[A][N]
The years of service you have given[N]
my family is already more than enough.[A][N]
ou must not abandon yourself for[N]
the sake of something like this.[A][N]
That is something that I've[N]
learned on my journey here.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
You... have indeed grown[N]
strong, Princess.[A][N]
It does my heart good to see that.[A][N]
But I beg of you...[N]
do not tarnish my honor so.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
I-I'm sorry, sir.[A][N]
If that is truly what you wish, then...[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Sir Orson, I agree with Princess Eirika.[A][N]
You should stay behind and rest.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
You as well, Seth? Surely you,[N]
if anyone, would understand.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
...I do.[N]
Very well then, Sir Orson.[A][N]
But if nothing else... please[N]
relinquish your weapon.[A][N]
You may injure yourself in your[N]
delirious state.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Seth? What weapon?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, Seth...[N]
what do you mean?[A][N]
Do you think prisoners are[N]
allowed to keep weapons?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Is that so?[A][N]
Then what is it that you[N]
are hiding in our doublet?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_OrsonUnwell]
That is-- this is...[A][N]
I must have picked it up during[N]
my escape.[A] As I said, I[N]
am not of proper mind.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
...Very well.[A][N]
Then please give me the weapon, Orson.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...[A][N]
[OpenRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Eirika]
[OpenRight][LoadFace_Seth]
Drop your weapon, Orson.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
O-Orson...? Don't tell[N]
me... did you intend to...?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Give me your bracelet,[N]
Princess Eirika. Otherwise...[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Do not move![A][N]
If you reach for your blade, I will cut you[N]
down where you stand.[A] Back away,[N]
and put your hands on the wall.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Seth, there is some misunderstanding[N]
here, I...[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Do it, Orson![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Tch...[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
S-Sir Orson? Did you truly[N]
intend to kill me?[A][N]
Did you betray my brother?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft]
Thank you, Orson. That's enough. You've done[N]
well -- we'll take over from here.[A][N]
I had hoped we could lure them into[N]
the dungeons, but...[A][N]
We'll have to face them on even ground.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Forgive me for placing such a burden[N]
on you, Sir Orson.[A][N]
As a fellow knight, I can understand[N]
how this must feel.[A][N]
But you know as well as I[N]
what is at stake here.[A][N]
We will secure her bracelet.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...Very well.[A][X]

[OpenRight]
Blackguard... who are you?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
We've never met, I am Lord Tirado.[A][N]
I must say, I am impressed.[A] To think[N]
that not even Valter could best you...[A][N]
And with some of the best men that[N]
Grado could offer.[A][N]
I'm of half mind to surrender...[N]
but I refuse such desires.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
...Valter? Do you mean that[N]
general? But... we have not met him.[A][N]
Not since the day you invaded[N]
our kingdom.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...What? But he took the majority[N]
of our forces out to meet you.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
What are you playing at?[A][N]
It is as the Princess says. We have not[N]
encountered any reinforcements.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
What?[A][N]
But then... where is he?[A][N]
Did he go down to the dungeons to[N]
meet with the prince...?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
! So my brother is truly here, then![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Tch,... dammit, what is going on?[A][N]
What of the plan?![A][N]
To arms, men! We shall protect[N]
Renvall until our dying breath![A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Eirika]
This is it, everyone![A][N]
For everything you have endured[N]
fighting by my side...[A][N]
I thank you![A] But I must ask[N]
for your aid one last time![A][N]
We shall conquer this castle and[N]
save my brother![A][N]
This is where I shall take[N]
back what was stolen from me![A][X]
