Explore Seth's budding feelings for  Eirika.
His argument is that his station forbids such
a romantic entanglement and would conflict
with his duty to her.
But it would be interesting to have someone
remind him (maybe Garcia or Duessel?) that
now Renais has fallen, he is less the knight
of a princess by royal decree, and more the
bodyguard of a woman he has chosen to protect.
What feelings of conflict he has on the matter
no longer have basis in reality.

In the vanilla game, Grado and Renais were said
to have very strong bonds, almost assuredly
helped by the kind nature of Vigarde. Yet
almost immediately after the war is triggered,
we see the majority of Grado's soldiers possessed
of a bloodthirsty amount of violence. With only
small contingents opposing the war in any form.
This puts the lore of the story in conflict
with the gameplay.
To remedy this, it'd be worth exploring Grado's
citizens unease at their emperor's prolonged absence
from public life, and the economic and social consequences
of Lyon leaving the throne empty while he dabbled in
dark magic research (famine, extortion, rape etc). 
Perhaps this allowed the rise to power of fanatics who took 
advantage of the chaos and steered the citizens growing 
hatred of their nation's lack of leadership towards
foreign borders in a bid to deflect the blame from Lyon/Vigarde
and sycophantically appease the prince. Which they
could then use to cement themselves a position in
governance? Maybe Riev could take this role?

When Valter suggests that Orson's loyalty is not
purely driven by matyric desires, I suspect what he's getting
at is that Orson is basically begging to die ever since
he lost his wife. So when he says that the two of them have
a lot to talk about, he's probably going to inform him of
Riev/Lyon/Knoll's experiments with reviving the dead.
