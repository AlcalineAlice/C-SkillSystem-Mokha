...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
How are you holding up, Eirika?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Hahaha...[A][N]
To be honest, Ephraim?[A][N]
I feel really... light.[A][N]
As if I just removed one of those[N]
heavy mantles you hate wearing.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Wow, that bad?[N]
I'm happy for you, then.[A][N]
And I'm... really impressed, too.[N]
You've gotten a lot stronger.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
Heehee, you think?[N]
Well, I've gotten quite a bit of exercise![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
You're telling me. Trecking from[N]
Frelia all the way here...[A][N]
If Lyon saw you now, his jaw[N]
would probably hit the ground and shatter.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Haha, probably...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Did you ever... hear anything[N]
from here while you were gone, Ephraim?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Not a whisper, I'm afraid.[N]
You didn't either, then?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
No...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
I see...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Do you remember, Ephraim?[A][N]
Almost two years ago now...[N]
we talked about him, right here in Serafew.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Did we?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
Yes...[A][X]

Ephraim! Lyon![A][N]
Where are you two?[A][N]
[OpenFarFarLeft]
We're over here, Eirika.[A][N]
You'd better be quick, Ephraim.[N]
Ephraim says he's tired of waiting.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh, please. He needs to learn a[N]
bit of patience, anyway.[A][X]

Well well, Eirika.[A][N]
For the first time in our lives,[N]
you're the late one.[A][N]
So this is what it feels like to be[N]
the prim and proper sibling.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Really, Brother? This attitude,[N]
after all the times I've forgiven you?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Come on now. Ephraim. There's no need[N]
to be so curt with her.[A][N]
A king must learn to treat people[N]
with respect and understanding.[A][N]
...Even if they are late.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Not you too, Lyon! You're supposed[N]
to be a gentleman.[A][N]
Oh no... has my brother[N]
already corrupted you so?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I-I'm sorry Eirika. I didn't mean to--[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Oh it's no matter.[A][N]
Once Ephraim comes back home, I'm sure[N]
you'll return to the kind boy you once were.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Y-you think?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
I can't believe you'd hurt my[N]
feelings so, Lyon.[A][N]
Would it truly be so awful[N]
to be like me?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Wh-what?[A][N]
No, I-I didn't mean... of course I want to...[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Heehee.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
The best thing about you, Lyon,[N]
is that you are oh-so-easy to tease.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Y-you two are terrible! I really thought[N]
I'd hurt you![A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
'Terrible'?[A][N]
Now what was that about respect[N]
and understanding?[A][N]
Besides, you couldn't hurt[N]
a fly with your demeanor.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Heehee. We're sorry, Lyon.[A][N]
Really, I apologize, to you,[N]
that I overslept.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Wait, what was that part in the middle?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
You will be heading south in a few[N]
weeks then, Lyon?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, Mother and I will visit a cousin living in[N]
a manse south of Taizel.[A][N]
I am to learn from the local bishop[N]
while I am there, so...[A][N]
We will probably stay there[N]
for a few months.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
I see... I'm really going to miss you.[A][N]
Maybe I should ask Father if I could[N]
come by and visit sometime?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh! W-would you?[A][N]
I, um... I would like that a lot.[A][N]
If you would, I mean.[A][N]
Mother really loves you, too, so[N]
I'm sure she would like it.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Truly? Oh I would love that.[A][N]
I've heard so much about the[N]
orchads in the region.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
W-well, if you want to, I could take[N]
you on a tour through them, and we--[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Oookay, break it off right there.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenRight]
Hm? What's wrong, Ephraim?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Oh, nothing important.[A][N]
Right, Lyon?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Right! Um... n-nothing important![A][N]
[OpenRight]
Well, if you say so...[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Yep.[N]
Moving the conversation right along...[A][N]
Anything special about that bishop, Lyon?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
What? Oh, yes![N]
Father Riev.[A][N]
He's not only a man of great faith, but a[N]
truly accomplished scholar.[A][N]
We have read several of his[N]
texts these past months.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Oh...[A][N]
...Have we?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Y-yes, Ephraim.[A][N]
We have.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
*sigh* I had hoped spending some time[N]
with you would change him, Lyon.[A][N]
But I see he's still as he was[N]
when we started studying.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
It's not my fault all these old books[N]
and tomes are so boring.[A][N]
Seriously, Eirika have you read some[N]
of them? They're terrible.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Yes, Ephraim. I have.[N]
Quite a while back.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
What was that one with the[N]
poem about again...[A][N]
Something about shadows and fire?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
"The crowned bore blades that stole the[N]
praise. Yet fires unseen had carved the way."[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Ah, that's the one.[A][N]
See, now that's interesting.[A][N]
Fires, blades and mystery,[N]
what's not to like?[A][N]
If more of the tomes were like[N]
that, I might not hate reading.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
It seems a lot less effort than[N]
General Duessel running you ragged.[A][N]
And you don't seem to mind that.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Of course I don't.[A][N]
Because that's fun.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
You can't just do the things you[N]
think are fun, Ephraim.[A][N]
You will be a king one day, and you[N]
need to--[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Hey now, that's not decided yet.[A][N]
Father is just as likely to make[N]
you queen instead.[A][N]
More likely, in fact.[A][N]
I just don't understand why he got so[N]
angry when I said you should be.[A][N]
I don't want to be king, you would make[N]
a great queen.[A] What's the issue?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
The issue is that even if you don't[N]
want to, you should still try![A][N]
It'd make you a more well-rounded[N]
person, and a proper prince![A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Uh-huh.[A] And what exactly would you know[N]
about being 'well-rounded', Sister?[A][N]
I've heard the maids call out[N]
my name when they see you, y'know.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Y-you vulgar--[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Hey, if we give you the proper clothes,[N]
Renais might have its new king, after all.[A][N]
Don't you agree, Lyon?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Wh-wh-what?[A] No, I, I mean that's not...[N]
I don't think she is, ah, that is to say...[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Grrrr...[A][N]

...Oops...[A][X]

...Now that I think on it...[A][N]
You were quite rude![A][N]
And you never apologized.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Ah, yes. Good times were had by all.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hmph...[A][N]
...Do you think he's still[N]
in the capital?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Hard to say. I would hope Vigarde[N]
would have him sent off to safety...[A][N]
But then, I never would have though him[N]
the man to start a war in the first place.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes... I just don't understand.[A][N]
Whenever we talked with him, he seemed...[N]
stern, but his eyes were filled with love.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
His eyes could be blessed by the Stones[N]
themselves and I wouldn't care.[A][N]
He is responsible for our father's death...[A][N]
And I will accept nothing less than his life[N]
in recompense for it.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Brother...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Not to worry, Eirika.[A][N]
Once we gt back to Frelia,[N]
you won't have to fight anymore.[A][N]
I'll take care of everything from[N]
here on.[A] It's what I'm here for.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
What? Don't be absurd, Brother.[A][N]
I refuse to sit in a room while[N]
you fight my battles for me.[A][N]
I have just as much of a stake[N]
in this conflict as you do.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Wow, finally starting to understand why[N]
I prefer fighting to reading?[A][N]
But relax.[A][N]
Once we get to safety, you'll realize[N]
just how much you've missed it.[A][N]
Come on, let's get going.[A][N]
It's probably about time for another[N]

I should have never sent you away![A][N]
I swear, I sprouted at least ten new grey[N]
hairs of worry![A] You aren't[N]
hurt, are you?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Forgive me, Father but...[A][N]
I was hurt quite badly... and it was[N]
Father Moulder's fault![A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
WHAT?![N]
I'll have his head![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Heehee! It was just a joke, Father[A][N]

Still as charming as you were[N]

[OpenLeft]
When I SAVED you at Renvall,[N]
thank you very much.[A][N]
And now that we are in front of my[N]
Father, would you care to thank me again?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Thank you very much for[N]
your aid, King Hayden.[A][N]
Had you not helped my sister in her[N]
time of need, I dread to think of what...[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Wait, that's not--[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Oh, it was the least I could do.[A][N]
I'm sure that your father would have done[N]
the same for my beloved children.[A][N]
You have... my deepest condolences[N]
for your loss, Prince Ephraim.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Thank you, Your Highness.[A][N]
It still feels... somewhat[N]
unreal to me.[A][N]
But my hatred for Vigarde burns[N]
all the same.[A][N]
I fear I cannot truly accept my Father's[N]
death until I've seen Vigarde dead.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
I see...[A][N]
That is quite understandable.[A][N]
Know that you have Frelia's support[N]
in this endeavour.[A][N]
[OpenRight][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Princess Eirika. It is so good[N]
to see you again.[A][N]
I feared I had made a terrible mistake when[N]
I allowed you to go, but...[A][N]
Seeing you now, it is clear[N]
I was wrong to doubt you.[A][N]
...[A][N]
...Princess Eirika?[N]
Is something the matter?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
What? Oh, no...[A][N]
Forgive me, Your Highness.[A][N]
I was merely... overcome[N]
with emotion.[A][N]
It is so good to see you again.[A][N]
I could not possibly have reached[N]
my brother without your aid.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
That may be true, but it was your[N]
conviction that was the deciding factor.[A][N]
When I look at you, it is hard to believe that[N]
you are the same woman you once were.[A][N]
And I see that you have found your once[N]
lost smile on this journey, as well.[A][N]
It seems I was right to trust Sir Seth[N]
then, after all...[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Hm? Did Seth do something?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh, it was nothing important.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Very well...[A][N]
But Your Highness, although we have[N]
found my brother...[A][N]
We uncovered many details about[N]
Grado's actions.[A][N]
We should sit down and talk--[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
We will, in due time.[A][N]
But now, it is starting to draw late.[A][N]
Innes will be back tommorow morning.[N]
We will discuss what is to come then.[A][N]

Good morning, Prince Inees.[A][N]
I'm glad to see that you have[N]
returned safely as well.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Naturally. My battles have not been[N]
nearly as precarious as yours.[A][N]
Disrupting Renvall's operations have[N]
eased Grado's aggressions.[A][N]
That I am able to return so soon is[N]
partly thanks to you.[A][N]
...And I see that you have[N]
returned as well.[A][N]
Your sister's quest in searching the[N]
bottom of the barrel was a success.[A][N]

Aaand a "good morning, I'm glad to see[N]
you again" to you too, Innes.[A][N]
I apologize for any worry I may have caused.[A][N]

King Fado was a great man.[A][N]

Why would I not?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, I didn't mean anything bad...[A][N]
But you don't like all that talk, right?[A][N]
It's uh, uncivilized behaviour and all that.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...I'm not a child, Ephraim.[N]
Do not treat me as one.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Hey, that's not what I meant.[A][N]
It's just that...[A][N]
Well, you don't need to feel[N]
as if you have to do this.[A][N]
You have... gotten[N]
stronger, certainly...[A][N]
But you just aren't built[N]
for stuff like this, you know?[A][N]
I just don't want you getting hurt.[A][N]
Come on, don't be mad.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
... ... ...[A][N]
I don't need your protection, Ephraim.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
What?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Let us talk more later.[A][N]
We don't want to be late.[A][N][ClearFace]

It does my heart good to see you all[N]
here safely within our castle walls.[A][N]
...Would that we have more time for[N]
pleasantries, but... let us hear your news.[A][N]
Innes?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Innes]
Yes. I have directed the body of Frelia's army[N]
to the south borders.[A][N]
Up until recently, we were close to[N]
being overrun...[A][N]
However, due to Princesss Eirika's daring[N]
attack on Renvall, their attention wavered.[A][N]
At the moment, the front is silent.[A][N]

[OpenMidLeft]
Very well.[A] Thank you for your efforts,[N]
as always, Innes.[A] And I extend my[N]
thanks to you as well, Princess Eirika.[A][N]
Though it was not your intent, you have[N]
given us an opening.[A][N]
Now, Prince Ephraim.[A] Did you learn[N]
of anything new while you were gone?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Well... not as such.[A][N]
We were often too busy fighting[N]
to stop and smell the roses.[A][N]
But... something strange did[N]
happen when we took Renvall.[A][X]

For what possible reason would an enemy[N]

The very prison he put you in?![A][N]
It defies all sense![A][N]
[OpenRight]
I don't know![A][N]
And I can't say I care to know how a man[N]
like him thinks.[A] He was... disturbing.[A][N]
But I do not lie.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
I believe my brother, Truth be told, when[N]
we assaulted Renvall...[A][N]
They seemed to have been under the[N]
impression that Valter rode to meet us.[A][N]
Yet we never met with him[N]
or his men.[A][N]
In truth, it seems it was not the strength[N]
of our group that prevailed...[A][N]
But the whims of that man.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Tch...[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Absurd...[N]
What an absolute farce.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
...It truly does seem[N]
beyond the pale.[A][N]
I have received reports on this[N]
General Valter.[A][N]
Before this war began, Vigarde had[N]
three trusted generals, but...[A][N]
It seems as though he has added an[N]
additional three to that number.[A][N]
General Valter being one of them.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
What do we know of him?[A][N]
From before this war began, I mean.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Not much.[A][N]
We know nothing of his family[N]
or of any noble lineage.[A][N]
What we do know is that he is known as a[N]
champion in many Grado arenas...[A][N]
And that he seems to share some form of[N]
connection with General Glen.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
In addition to Valter...[N]
there is also General Caellach.[A][N]
He also seems to share many similarities[N]
with Valter.[A] No known family,[N]
a history of bloody combat as a mercenary.[A][N]
He was born in Jehanna, but has traveled[N]
the continent with a mercenary troupe.[A][N]
How he came into contact with[N]
Vigarde is unknown.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
And then there's the strangest[N]
of them all... General Riev.[A][N]
He is a scholar and holy man born in[N]
Rausten, but later moved to Grado.[A][N]
He has written many theological and[N]
philosophical texts, read to this day.[A][N]
He seems to have lived a humble life[N]
in the southern reaches of Grado...[A][N]
But he was quickly promoted to the seat of[N]
Bishop, of Grado's Imperial Temple.[A][N]
That was about a year ago...[A][N]
And now Vigarde has made him a[N]
general of his army.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Hmmm...[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Recent reports have become[N]
even more bizarre.[A][N]
Our scouts have reported sightings[N]
of undead creatures roaming the land.[A][N]
Which concide with the findings[N]
General Seth submitted prior to this meeting.[A][N]
Their direction of travel seems to indicate[N]
their origin being somewhere near Grado.[A][X]

Hold! He is unarmed and[N]
presents us no danger.[A][N]
If you raise your weapon against him[N]
I will kill you where you stand.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Caellach]
Yikes! Calm down there, lady.[A][N]
What's the big deal? You didn't[N]
complain about all the others I killed.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
You do not raise your blade to anyone[N]
powerless to resist you![A][N]
I do not care about what your life[N]
has been up to this point.[A][N]
You are now a general representing[N]
the Empire of Grado.[A][N]
We are not murderers.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hah! Oh, that's rich![A][N]
Is that what you tell yourself to[N]
make it easier to sleep at night?[A][N]
That killing's not a big deal as long as[N]
daddy dear emperor tell you it's okay?[A][N]
You sure have the moral high ground here![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Wretch...[A] My patience runs[N]
thin.[A][N]
Silence yourself before I[N]
do it for you.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hey, sure, no need to[N]
get so worked up about it.[A][N]
I get it. You're a true[N]
and loyal soldier-- awesome![A][N]
I won't kill the bloke.[N]
Happy?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
As happy as you'be been this[N]
entire trip, I guess![A][N]
Well, no point standing around[N]
here all day.[A][N]
You can take this little doohickey[N]
back to Vigarde, right?[A][N]
I'll take my men and head east,[N]
to Jehanna.[A][N]
Saar's little scheme really cut down[N]
a lot of the busy work in getting here.[A][N]
My men are still hungry for[N]
some action.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
What are you playing at?[N]
Our orders were to simply--[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yeah, take Frelia's Stone, I know.[A][N]
But hey, the old man wants all of 'em, right?[A][N]
Might as well get started on that already![N]
Initiative is appreciated, you know.[A][N]
Maybe he'd pay more attention to[N]
you if you did somethin unexpected?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
You...![A][N]
Do whatever you will.[A][N]
But know that I will report your[N]
misconduct.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yeah, you do that.[A][N]
See you 'round.[A][N]

...We shall now reconvene.[A][N]
We have received reports of the events[N]
that took place atop the tower.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Generals Selena and Caellach did[N]
indeed attack the tower.[A][N]
We have lost our Sacred Stone.[A][N]
...I accept full responsibility[N]
for this, Father.[A][N]
I grew... too arrogant.[N]
I underestimated the enemy...[A][N]
And overestimated myself.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
...Thank you, Innes. But now,[N]
we can no longer stand still.[A][N]
We do not know what Grado has[N]
planned, but...[A][N]
Given recent discoveries, we simply[N]
cannot allow them to do as they please.[A][N]
It is high time we launched[N]
our counterattack.[A][N]
...With that said,[N]
Grado's army is superior.[A][N]
They must have prepared for this[N]
campaign for some time, now.[A][N]
Alone, I do not think we hold[N]
the power to reclaim our Stone..[A][N]
Or avenge King Fado.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
...We must unite our forces[N]
with Jehanna and Rausten.[A][N]
That is the only way for us to reclaim[N]
the Stones of Frelia and Renais.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Ah... you need not fear[N]
for the safety or our Stone.[A][N]
Grado cannot access it.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
? What do you mean, Eirika?[A][N]
Our Stone is kept in the temple.[A][N]
It should have been easy for Grado[N]
to claim it.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Come now, Ephraim.[A][N]
There's no reason to keep this[N]
from them at this point in time.[A][N]
The truth is, King Hayden, that[N]
our father hid our Stone.[A][N]
The only way to access it is through[N]
the bracelets that Ephraim and I wear.[A][N]
As long as we hold these, our Stone[N]
will elude them.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
...What are you talking about...?[A][N]
I've never...[N]
I was never told of this![A][X]

Brother...?[A][N]
B-Brother! Where is your bracelet...?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
He... Valter took it...[A][N]
What is the meaning of this?[N]
! Did Orson know about this?![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Y-yes... He, Seth, a few others...[A][N]
Father told me a few years ago[A][N]
But...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Why...?[A][N]
Why didn't Father tell me?![A][N]
Did he not trust me...?[N]
I don't understand![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...I do not know.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
Dammit...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Innes]
Are you quite done?[A][N]
You've had hours to stew[N]
in your own thoughts now.[A][N]
We need to focus our attention[N]
on more important details.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
...Right.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
Returning to matters at hand.[A][N]
According to a survivor of the[N]
attack on the tower...[A][N]
General Caellach is planning to[N]
claim Jehanna's stone next.[A][N]
To secure an alliance, it would[N]
be in our best interests to stop him.[A][N]
However, we cannot cut through[N]
Renais to reach Jehanna Hall...[A][N]
Nor do we have the strength to leave[N]
Frelia unprotected.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Innes]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Hayden]
You need not worry about[N]
Frelia's security, son.[A][N]
If you take enough men to spare[N]
and cut through the east mountains...[A][N]
I will stay here and see to my[N]
kingdom's safety.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...Yes, Father.[A][N]
If you beliee that is best.[A][N]
Princess Eirika,[N]
Prince Ephraim.[A][N]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace_Eirika]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace_Ephraim]
[OpenMidRight]
Though I am loathe to ask for it...[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Of course we will join you.[A][N]
But I will need to ask my companions[N]
who among them are willing to join.[A][N]
And... I believe it will be[N]
for the best if I leave my bracelet here.[A][N]
With Grado holding its counterpart, it is[N]
too dangerous to carry it with me.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
We will be sure to keep it safe.[A][N]
...What say you, Prince?[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
...Yes, of course.[A][N]
My men and I will join you.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Then it is decided.[N]
Take the time you need to prepare.[A][N]
I will take my men near Carcino,[N]
and we will reconvene there.[A][N]
I will also prepare a letter for Rausten,[N]
requesting their aid.[A][N]
Are there any objections to these plans?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...Good. Then may the Heavens[N]
and their Stones bless us.[A][X]

[OpenMidRight]
...[A][N]
It doesn't... make sense.[A][N]
There is no reason for Father to not[N]
have trusted me with it.[A][N]
He trusted Orson with it! Yet[N]
he's the one who betrayed us![A][N]
...Was Orson planning on[N]
selling us out from the very start?[A][N]
He... Father should not[N]
have trusted him.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I do not know the answer to[N]
any of your questions, Ephraim.[A][N]
...But you need not worry.[A][N]
My bracelet is still here and Grado needs[N]
both of them to reach our Stone.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
That's not the problem here![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...You're wrong, Ephraim.[A][N]
That IS the issue we are facing.[A][N]
I understand that you[N]
are upset, but...[A][N]
We need to focus on the present.[N]
I shall go and inform my friends.[A][N]
...I will see you[N]
later then, Brother.[A][N]
