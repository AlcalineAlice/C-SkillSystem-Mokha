This is terrible..![A] What are we going[N]
to do?[A] Those bandits are so close...[A][N]
If we can't find some way to protect[N]
ourselves, the village is doomed...![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Eirika]
People, listen to me![A] You must close[N]
the village gates immediately.[A][N]
Hurry, before the bandits arrive![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Hm?[A] Who are you?[A] You aren't from one[N]
of the neighbouring towns, are you?[A][N]
And your weapons give you away...[N]
You're no peasant.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I am...[A] My name is Erda.[A][N]
I'm a mercenary.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
A mercenary, is it?[A][N]
And named after the late Queen[N]
of Renais, Erdalinde, I assume?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, ...she was loved by her--[A][N]
by my family, so...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Perfectly reasonable.[A][N]
Though I never had the pleasure of a[N]
meeting, I'm told she was quite enchanting.[A][N]
Ah, I haven't introduced myself, have I?[A][N]
I am Selena, a general in Grado's army.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
...!![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Do you take issue with that?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...No, of course not.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Heh, very well.[A][N]
It looks like these villagers[N]
have some bandit troubles.[A][N]
I would like to help, but[N]
I have my orders.[A][N]
I'm to leave for the capital[N]
immediately, and so I cannot stay.[A][N]
You're armed, and you claim to be[N]
a mercenary.[A] Will you help them?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Is there a problem?[A][N]
If it's a matter of payment, then--[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
N-no![A] Of course I'll help them![A][N]
It's just... you're one of[N]
Grado's generals... so why would...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...These aren't soldiers.[A][N]
They're people.[A][N]
Should they suffer because[N]
their leaders fight?[A][N]
I've petitioned your aid.[A][N]
Take this as payment.[A][N]

W-wait please![A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
What is it?[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
You're one of the imperial three,[N]
so you should know.[A][N]
Why, why did Emperor Vigarde[N]
start this senseless war?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
He didn't.[A][N]
He...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Didn't what?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][BoxType_InnerMonologue]
This whole situation is madness...[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidRight]
Wait what does that mean?[A][N]
Selena![A][X]

...[A][N]
Who are you? You don't seem like[N]
the local peasantry.[A][N]
As you can see, these villagers[N]
have some bandit troubles.[A][N]
I would like to help, but I have[N]
orders to follow...[A][N]
I am required to leave this area[N]
at once.[A][N]
I would ask you to aid them in this fight.[N]
I will pay you for your trouble, of course.[A][X]

Oooh! The most wonderous man[N]
just rescued me.[A][N]
He was dressed like a mercenary, but[N]
he had an air of elegance about him...[A][N]
He seemed like a bit of a playboy.[A][N]
C-could this be... true love?![A][N]
...Kyah! Y-Y-You didn't hear anything![A][N]
T-Take this elixir and[N]
DON'T SAY ANYTHING![A][X]

Please, accept this small token.[A][X]

Hey lady, are you with these mercs?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Mercs? Well I am but-[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
Listen, my village is being attacked[N]
by bandits![A][N]
Come on! You have to help me wipe[N]
those thugs out![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
S-slow down child, what did you say[N]
your name was?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
My name's Ross, and I'm not a child![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
All right, just take a deep breath and[N]
calm down, Ross.[A][N]
Leave the village to us.[A][N]
We'll help drive off the bandits.[N]
Seth, take the boy somewhere safe.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
No! Wait! I'm going to fight, too![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
But...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
My father is out there all alone,[N]
fighting all of those bandits...![A][N]
I've got to get back to him as[N]
quickly as possible![A][N]
[ToggleSmile]
I'm the son of the great Garcia![A][N]
As long as I have my axe, no[N]
bandit will ever beat me![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
All right... I can see you're[N]
not going to be swayed...[A][N]
But you must promise you will stay[N]
close to us.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Deal.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
Garcia... why does that sound familiar?[A][X]

Dad![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Ross? Boy, what did I tell[N]
you?! What are you doing here?[A][N]
Don't worry about me, hurry up[N]
and get yourself to safety![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Did you really think I could just[N]
run away while you fight, Dad?[A][N]
You taught me that fighters fight[N]
for what's important to them.[A][N]
There's no way I'm leaving![A][N]
I'm a fighter just like you![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...all right.[A] We'll cut our way out[N]
of here together![A][X]
