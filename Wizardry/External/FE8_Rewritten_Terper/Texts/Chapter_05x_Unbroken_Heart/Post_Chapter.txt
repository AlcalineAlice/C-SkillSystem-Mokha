Well, I'd say we've 'thrashed about'[N]
quite enough.[A][N]
If nothing else, cleaning up this mess should[N]
keep them busy for a while.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
That was the plan.[A][N]
Now then, let's see if I can remember[N]
how to do this...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]

[OpenLeft][LoadFace_Forde]
[OpenFarRight]
...Hm?[A][N]
...It--it's not working...![A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Wh-what do you mean,[N]
'it's not working'?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight]
Hnngh...![A] I can't.[.].[.][.] get it open![A][N]
Blast it! Did they seal it off?[A][X]

Prince Ephraim! Things have[N]
taken a turn for the worse...[A][N]
I took a look around the castle perimeter...[....]
we're surrounded.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
What?![A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Argh! This was a trap...?![A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Prince! What should we do?![A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Tch... we must escape![A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Valter]
How impressive![A][N]
You've captured Renvall, have you?[N]
And with such a small force![A][N]
I must say, I quite admire[N]
your work, Prince.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Tch. Spare me your sarcastic tongue.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
On, it's not sarcasm![N]
Well, not a lot.[A][N]
I am honestly impressed with[N]
your tenacity.[A][N]
Your band has survived for weeks[N]
in enemy territory.[A][N]
To last as long as you have[N]
is nothing short of a miracle.[A][N]
But your well of luck[N]
has now run dry.[A][N]
And I must say, I am quite[N]
disappointed.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
What do you mean?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
For months on end I've heard[N]
about you, you know.[A][N]
Your skill, your mind...[N]
that you are strong.[A][N]
But this will not do.[A][N]
You are exhausted and stand[N]
before the guillotine.[A][N]
I had hoped for a proper[N]
chance to test your might.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][HalfCloseEyes]
I can't say I care.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, I do![A][N]
I don't care to kill those[N]
who can't bite back.[A][N]
It bores me.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Orson]
My Prince! Behind me![A][N]
[MoveRight]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight]
[OpenMidLeft]
Speaking of which![A]
You would be Sir Orson,[N]
would you not?[A][N]
Such a shame... had I met you[N]
in your prime...[A][N]
Oh, our deadly embrace would[N]
been ever so sweet![A][N]
But fear not, knight.[A][N]
I did not come to claim the boy's[N]
head quite yet.[A][N]
I will be satisfied with[N]
throwing him in a cell.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
...[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Tch! Not worthy to die[N]
at your lance yet, am I?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, that is MY foremost reason.[A][N]
Fattening a pig before the slaughter[N]
is how your bring out the taste.[A][N]
And locking a spoiled little brat such[N]
as yourself in the darkest dungeons...[A][N]
The idea carries a certain charm,[N]
don't you think?[A][N]
But, I digress.[A] I would also like to know[N]
where you've hidden the Sacred Stone.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Huh?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
!![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh?[A][N]
Going by your reactions, I'd say[N]
the boy knows nothing...[A][N]
But YOU seem to be in the know.[A][N]
So come, Sir Orson.[N]
Tell me where the real Stone is.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Over my dead body![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Ever the valiant knight.[A][N]
But I wonder...[....][N]
Is it truly loyalty that drives your[N]
martryic desires?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hahahaa...[N]
Ahahahahaha!![A][N]
Oh, your eyes![N]
I've seen them before![A][N]
Come, Sir Orson, let us talk.[A][N]
Lay down your arms and I promise[N]
not to harm the boy.[A][N]
I believe we have much to discuss...[A][X]
