Novala, m friend.[N]
I assume the field test was[N]
a success?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Of course, Bishop.[A][N]
We successfully rose the fallen[N]
near Za'ha.[A][N]
The nearby temple then sent out[N]
a holy man to banish them.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Good, good.[A][N]
I'm glad the heeded our warning.[A][N]
And how were they?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh, he was quite[N]
handsome, truth be told.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Not the man, fool, the undead![A][N]
Did they act in accordance with[N]
our expectations?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh! Ye-yes, they were as[N]
mindless as before.[A][N]
No sense of morality or...[N]
'self' in general.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, I suppose it was foolish[N]
of me to hope for more just yet.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh, but there was one more thing...[A][N]
The man did not battle the undead alone.[N]
He received aid from another party.[A][N]
We believe them to have been the[N]
displaced Princess Eirika's party.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh? So she's thrust herself this deep[N]
into enemy territory?[A][N]
We seem to have misunderstood[N]
the girl.[A][N]
Still it is not our business. Valter[N]
already managed to capture the Prince.[A][N]
And according to him the Prince knows[N]
nothing about their Stone.[A][N]
So I doubt her father would have[N]
told her how to access it either.[A][N]
Still...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Bishop? Is somthing the matter?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
There is the matter of the[N]
traitor, Natasha.[A][N]
If she were to make contact[N]
with the Princess...[A][N]
Then Frelia may learn of our plans[N]
sooner than ideal.[A][N]
We'd better be safe than sorry.[A][N]
Continue your experiments on the[N]
local, hrm, 'wildlife'...[A][N]
But if you come across the girl,[N]
then capture her.[A][N]
I must be off, now.[A][N]
Valter wished to speak about[N]
matters regarding the undead.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, Bisho--[N]
Oh he's already gone.[A][X]

Speak of the devil![N]
If it isn't Princess Eirika![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
What?![N]
Wh-who are you?![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh, I am simple, dutiful shaman.[A][N]
In the employ of Grado's[N]
Imperial Temple.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...I see.[A][N]
And is raising the dead part of[N]
your 'Imperial' duties?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
!![A] So, the traitor[N]
did fine you then.[A][N]
Well, so be it.[A][N]
Once we've locked you up in[N]
Renvall, Frelia will know nothing.[A][N]
But please, fear not.[A][N]
We'll be kind enough to place you in[N]
the same cell your brother occupies![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Wh-what?[A] You've...[N]
captured Ephraim...?[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
Blackheart![A][N]
I swear I will--![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Ah ah ah! No sudden movements.[N]
Or the child dies![A][X]
